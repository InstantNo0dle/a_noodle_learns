The reason why each pigment has its unique absorption spectrum: - A pigment is normally in its ground state -- its electrons are in its normal orbital - If a photon is absorbed, the electrons will be elevated to an orbital with higher energy; the pigment is in its excited state ^1e2327 - This state is highly unstable, so the electrons will drop back down to the normal orbital, releasing heat - The absorbed proton will be released too, leading to fluorescence [!important] A pigment will only absorb a photon whose energy is equal to the difference between energies of the excited and ground states; this varies between different types of pigments. Steps : 1. White light separated into colors by a prism 2. Different colors of light passed through a sample 3. Light hits a photoelectric tube , converting light to electricity 4.

million people annually die in road accidents and it is the leading cause of death in kids from 5-29 years old. The most common causes of these accidents are speeding, driving under influence and distracted driving, among others (WHO, 2018). The main motivation for manufacturing autonomous vehicles is a need for safer driving. Autonomous vehicles are those that have features allowing for movement from one point to another without any human intervention. Some features include sensing the environment, connecting to the internet, obeying traffic rules, self-navigation, making quick decisions, and ensuring safety of all road agents. The use of these features is able to reduce human error-caused road accidents, fuel consumption, and traffic (Parekh et al., 2022). In order to make quick decisions of the best route to take in places crowded with people, the autonomous vehicle makes use of pedestrian trajectory prediction to prevent collisions (Sighencea et al., 2021). Pedestrian trajectory prediction is the use of past motion of the pedestrian to predict future locations (Rasouli, Kotseruba et al., 2019). There has been much progress with the computational part of pedestrian trajectory prediction with the development of several state of the art models, such as Trajectron++ (Salzmann et al., 2021), BiTraP (Yao et al., 2020), and Social NCE (Liu et al., 2021), all perform markedly better than baseline models. Although these state of the art models have high performance on datasets as a whole, there is large disparity in performance between different age demographics. It is found for both BiTraP and Trajectron++ in unpublished work. In particular, both models performed worse on the senior demographic. This demographic is already more susceptible to collisions, with drivers over 70 years old having higher crash death rates per 1,000 crashes than middle-aged adults (35-54 years old) (CDC WISQARS, 2022). This increase in mortality rate has been discussed to partially be caused by changes in vision, physical ability, memory, and some diseases or medications that affect driving ability (Pomidor, 2019). Not only did the models perform worse on the senior demographic, but also the child demographic. Similarly to the seniors, children are vulnerable. 20% of children under the age of 15 killed in car crashes were pedestrians, compared to the 17% of people older than 15 (CDC WISQARS, 2022). Because these populations are more prone to collisions, it is even more crucial to ensure equal, if not better performance than on middle-aged adults. Ensemble learning or ensemble model is the combination of multiple predictions from different models to make the final prediction. This optimization method has shown to be a good approach to increase a model's performance both experimentally and theoretically: A similar mechanism to Marquis de Condorcet theorem in political science is what leads to such improvements (Ganaie et al., 2022). Thus, it will be used to improve the performance on both demographics by combining an object detection model with a pedestrian trajectory prediction model. In the machine learning community, it is generally accepted that the more data a model is trained on, the better it performs (Zhu et al., 2015). The main reason for this is the fact that a model aims to solve a problem by taking inputs and fine tuning a function that maps the input onto the output. So the more input/output pairs (data) a model is given, the more \"fine-tuned\" the function is! This idea will be implemented by training the ensemble model on multiple datasets amalgamated into one so it can better encapsulate the relationship between the input and outputs. The aim of this study is focused on whether using such an ensemble model as described before will improve the model's performance on vulnerable demographics. Research question and hypothesis \u00b6 [!question]+ Will using an object detection model 1 with the pedestrian trajectory prediction model 2 improve its performance on vulnerable demographics? [!note]+ Hypothesis Implementing an object detection model 1 in conjunction with the pedestrian trajectory prediction model 2 will significantly improve its performance on children and elderly in all metrics compared to baseline tests with just the pedestrian trajectory prediction model. The baseline pedestrian trajectory prediction model Trajectron++ 2 has been trained on two datasets -- nuScenes and ETH-UCY -- both of which have data predominantly concerning adults. It is well known in the field of machine learning that generally, the more data the model is given during training, the better it's able to predict during test time. To compensate for this lack of diversity in age ranges, an object detection model (YOLOv7 1 ) is used to conditionally load the best parameters onto Trajectron++. Additionally, it will be trained with multiple sources of data, an aggregate of multiple datasets. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the combination of these factors will aid in the model's performance and contribute to a significant increase.
