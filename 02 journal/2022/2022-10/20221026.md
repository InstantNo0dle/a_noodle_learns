### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 2x 5 400s + 2 400s of third set -- 1st of each set @ 5k pace, then gets faster, 5th 400 is the fastest of each set
- *Strava log*: [3.2 mi Run Activity on October 26, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/8024244767)

**How did you feel on your run?**
The Vaporflys are awesome! They are so responsive and have excellent energy return. Simply *knowing* that I could go faster helped my mental game a lot and I got a great workout out of it. I still had some gas left in the tank so I pushed the last 400 @ 5:57 pace! 

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
Assuming that we're following the boys' running schedule this week, I should have a recovery scheduled. I'm looking forward to it ðŸ˜œ.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
Just keep running, don't think too hard about it, just keep the legs moving and it'll be okay :).
