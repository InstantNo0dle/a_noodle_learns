### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* Library loop + blacktop, bigger woods loop, quad + blacktop to double doors, 3x blacktop sprints (2 to double doors)
- *Strava log*: [3.2 mi Run Activity on October 21, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7998513386/overview)

**How did you feel on your run?**
It felt worse than and better than what I expected, at the same time. Of course by the third repeat I was in pain, but I pushed through it. I tried to stay focused and concentrate on the movement of my arms, but it was difficult. 

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
It's rest day! I still have a long day though, but hopefully I can recover well for the race I have on Sunday.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I still need to work on being more focused and not thinking about the pain, just concentrating in the moment.
