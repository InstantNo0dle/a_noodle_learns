### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* ~3.3 miles easy recovery
- *Strava log*: [3.5 mi Run Activity on October 18, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7984444171)

**How did you feel on your run?**
I ran with Laura and Sarah and it was very fun to just talk the whole time ðŸ˜„. It was also a proper one because I wasn't forced to go fast and took it pretty chill. Again, I kept working on my arm swing and I hope that it will help me in the meet. In the future, I'll probably do more recoveries like this.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
The last (actually last) Eisenhower meet is tomorrow! I'm going to try my best to PR.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I could work on not being super paranoid about my pace and not checking my watch every 10 seconds to see how fast I'm going.
