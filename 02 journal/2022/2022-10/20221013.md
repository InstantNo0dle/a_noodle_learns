### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* ~3.25 mile easy run
- *Strava log*: [https://www.strava.com/activities/7959205081](https://www.strava.com/activities/7959205081)

**How did you feel on your run?**
It didn't feel that good at the beginning, but things went upwards from there and at the end, I felt much better. I tried to keep my heart rate fairly low and it felt like an easy effort (exactly how it's supposed to feel). It started to drizzle (very lightly) towards the end of the run and I was glad that I made it back before the heavy rain set in.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
I'll be back at XC practice tomorrow, and since it's a Friday, Hudson is sure to have a "fun" workout up his sleeve.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
It would be to really focus, mentally, during the run. Whether that's focusing on thinking about my life or focusing on the very act of running, I need to practice *focus* so I can perform well come racetime.
