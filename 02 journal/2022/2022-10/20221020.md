### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 3.3 miles easy with Sarah
- *Strava log*: [3.3 mi Run Activity on October 20, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7994295126)

**How did you feel on your run?**
Feeling good as usual ðŸ˜ƒ. Sarah was a decent pacer and I was able to stay at a constant easy pace while running with her. Since I hit the weight room in the morning for morning gym, my quads and hamstrings were pretty tight, but it improved over the course of the run. To be honest, I'm surprised that we got a recovery today because usually the day after a race, we have a workout.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
Coach Hudson probably plans a workout since he was *nice* today and gave us a recovery.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I'll keep reminding myself to stay relaxed and focused.
