### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 3.7 miles tempo
- *Strava log*: [3.7 mi Run Activity on October 17, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7979258113/overview)

**How did you feel on your run?**
The arm thing really works! It helped me to reach ~8:30 pace without exerting too much effort (or feeling like it...), but my heart rate told a different story once I went sub 8. I almost ran negative splits with a good mile and a half being sub 8, so I'm pretty satisfied! Obviously I can't run like this every day, but I'm smart about it ðŸ¤“  -- I knew that tomorrow would be a recovery. If I implement this arm trick raceday (Wednesday), maybe, just maybe, I can drop a massive PR.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
Recovery! It's the day before the race so whether Hudson likes it or not, I'm taking it chill ðŸ˜Ž.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
When I transition back into running on my own again, I need to make sure to warmup (take the first 1 mile easy) before jumping into anything substantially hard.
