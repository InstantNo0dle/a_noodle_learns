### Running Log #running 
*The run itself*: Mile repeats for 3.58 miles (2 victories, 1 set of 2 quads)
- *Strava log*: [3.5 mi Run Activity on October 11, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7948594941/overview)

**How did you feel on your run?**
I felt okay and strong for the most part because it was the first workout of the week (after 2 recovery days). On the first victory, I had a pretty good pace and mainly focused on form (high cadence and midfoot strike) but really needed to pee. So, I went. This ended up being a huge mistake as by the time I came back, my group had left for what I thought was the second victory. I did a second victory, this time a tad bit more painful than the first but still feeling decent aside from stomach cramps. Turns out, while I did a second victory, they had done quads instead üò¢ . Sweaty and feeling a bit sick, I ran a set of two quads, again focusing on form and just running. In the end, I need to go poop üí© real bad but at least I got through the workout. 

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
Hudson has another hard workout cooking ü•ò so I'm praying for my legs to feel decent by 3:00 pm tomorrow.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I should start drinking more water üòÜ and maybe use the time in between school finishing and XC practice starting to sleep?
