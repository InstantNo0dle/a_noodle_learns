### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 3.56 miles easy @ ~9:25 pace
- *Strava log*: [https://www.strava.com/activities/7954074485](https://www.strava.com/activities/7954074485)

**How did you feel on your run?**
I felt good! Even though I ran with Izzy and Emily, I was able to have a *true* recovery running at a comfortable pace. I once again tried to keep the cadence high and focused a lot on form.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
I want to do an early morning run (maybe 3-4 miles) at 6:00 AM for ~30 mins and a faster session after school before going to Cold Spring Harbor.

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I still need to work on drinking more water.
