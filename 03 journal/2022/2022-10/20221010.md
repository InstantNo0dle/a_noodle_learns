### Running Log #running 
**How did you feel on your run?**
It felt pretty good, and I constantly reminded myself to give an easy effort and tried to keep the HR low. I realized (probably way too late) that running the same moderate to hard effort every day is not going to make me faster. Every time in the past when I thought I was doing an "easy" run, it was not easy. I **have** to remember to keep my easy days (3-4 days/week) truly easy and my hard days (2-3 days/week) decently hard. I already feel not as tired as I usually am, which is great because it gives me more energy to invest into other plans.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
After one day off, it's back to school ;-;. I'm sure Coach Hudson has a hard workout planned so I need to mentally prepare myself for the impending suffering and doom. 

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I really need to bring tissues along when I run so that I don't have to grab a handful of leaves (sorry trees) to blow my nose on.
