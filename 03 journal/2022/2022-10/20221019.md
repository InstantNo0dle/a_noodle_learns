### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 3.1 miles 5k race!
- *Strava log*: [3.1 mi Run Activity on October 19, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/7989894754#comments)

**How did you feel on your run?**
I BROKE 22!!! ðŸ˜„ ðŸŽ‰ Season PR and very close to overall PR. Ran a 21:49, so around 10 seconds off. I'm super happy with this result and felt pretty relaxed throughout the race. I did use the "arm-swing mentality" and I think it helped keep me focused. I've set my eyes on running an overall PR before the season ends.

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
I have Cold Spring Harbor tomorrow so I think I'll probably do a 30 minute easy run. 

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I have to remind myself that I *can* do it and that I *will* be able to do anything -- my doubts are the only things holding me back.
