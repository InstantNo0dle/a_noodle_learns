### Running Log #running  
*The run itself:* 8k race!!!
- *Strava log*: [5.0 mi Run Activity on October 23, 2022 by Erin W. on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/8007176508)
- *Elitefeats race results*: [Race Timers New York Long Island elitefeats Results Details](https://www.elitefeats.com/res-det.asp?ID=22827&BibID=100)

**How did you feel on your run?**
I definitely went out too fast. After the first mile, I knew I couldn't keep the pace for the whole race and slowed down. It started hurting towards the end but honestly it wasn't bad for the first time racing that distance! I ended up coming in 10th overall for women's and 1st in my age group (since there was only one other person). 

**What do you plan to do tomorrow?**
I have science bowl practice after school tomorrow but hopefully I'll be able to go to practice. It's definitely a workout though (like 95% confident), but I'm not sure whether Hudson will be there. 

**What's one thing you could improve to make future you more successful?**
I need to work on pacing myself and perceiving my limits and what I'm capable of. Essentially, I need to be more in tune with my body.
