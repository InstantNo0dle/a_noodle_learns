I decided to film myself writing my english essay and I think I'm going to start a youtube channel for study-with-me videos. It should be easy to make content since I basically study all the time anyways and may give me some motivation! Maybe if I get enough views/subs I can get paid (well that's wishful thinking) and perhaps... sponsors? (Custom keeb when...)
