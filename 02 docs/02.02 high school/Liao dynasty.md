# Liao dynasty

This was the dynasty that coexisted (albeit not exactly peacefully) with the [[Song dynasty]].

It was founded in 907 by nomadic **Khitans** from Manchuria who were highly influenced by Chinese culture. They viewed the Song dynasty as culturally superior and borrowed a lot from them.

The Song paid a lot of tribute to keep them from raiding/conquering.
