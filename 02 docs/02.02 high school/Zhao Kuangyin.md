# Zhao Kuangyin

He rose to reunite China under the [[Song dynasty]] after the dissolution of the [[Tang dynasty]]. 

Zhao was known as the most honest and capable of the generals struggling for control of the north after the fall of the Tang. He was a fierce warrior but was also knowledgeable, collecting books instead of booty when he raided.

Because of this, his troops and supporters urged him to declare himself as emperor, which he did, as **Emperor Taizu**.

He was eventually able to conquer all rival groups, except for the [[Liao dynasty]].
- Set precedent for weakness against northern nomadic peoples; later ended in downfall of the Song by the Mongols
