# Song dynasty
### Rise
Similar to how Li Yuan of the [[Tang dynasty#^cf772b|Tang dynasty]] saved China from going into another period of nomadic dominance, unrest, etc., [[Zhao Kuangyin]] did the same, founding the Song dynasty.

### Fall
The way the Song dealt with the [[Liao dynasty]] later came to bite them in the butt ðŸ˜¬ . Other nomadic tribe saw their weakness and began to form their own kingdoms near the northern borders.
- **Xi Xia kingdom** was formed by the Tibetan **Tangut** tribes
- Now the Song had to pay even *more* tribute, putting more pressure on the peasant class

Some recognized the impending downfall, like [[Wang Anshi]], but it was inevitable.

A new nomadic tribe (Jurchens) conquered the [[Liao dynasty]] and formed the Jin kingdom. They were able to successfully invade the Song and take the Yellow River basin. 

The Song dynasty became the **Southern Song**, basically just a tiny state centered around the Yangzi river. As always, while it was suffering politically, culturally, it was *"one of the most glorious in Chinese history --- perhaps in the history of humankind."*

## Political System
The Song was never able to regain its political strength from the golden ages of the [[Tang dynasty]], but set many policies to try to prevent the problems that destroyed the Tang from happening.
- Civil administrators (scholar-gentry) were *superior* to military
- Only civil officials could be governors
- Military commanders were rotated to prevent building power in where they resided

The **scholar-gentry**, on the other hand, were elevated, claiming to be the key to prevent warlord influence. Their lives became more luxurious and government offices became more highly sought after. 

Civil service exams were now given regularly, every three years at three levels -- district, provincial, and imperial -- but many more people passed than during the Tang. 

## Social system and culture
There was a revival of Confucianism due to the high status of the scholar-gentry. Confucianist ideology and values dominated the "intellectual" sphere.
- Established academies and libraries for studying ancient texts
- Tried to recover old texts and decipher hidden meanings
- In particular, the [[Neo-Confucians]] played a large role

New schools of thought arose, promoting **indigenous** teachings like Confucianism and Daoism over "imported" ones like Buddhism, continuing the negative trend (about Buddhism) seen in the  [[Tang dynasty#^7114e5|late Tang]].
