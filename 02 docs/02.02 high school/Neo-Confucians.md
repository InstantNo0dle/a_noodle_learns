# Neo-Confucians

These were people who believed themselves to be **revivers** of ancient Confucian teachings. They thought that the main goal of life was to gain high morality (whatever that means).

They believed that morality could be increased through:
- Gaining knowledge from books
- Personal observation
- Contact with **men** of wisdom and higher morality

Some of their ideologies included:
- Hostility to "foreign" philosophies
- If men and women deferred to their positions and obeyed by age and social rank, everything would be harmonious
- Analyzing the past is the best guide to facing the future

Their ideologies continued to impact China well after the [[Song dynasty]] and ultimately made Chinese rulers and bureaucrats less receptive to foreign influences (not much innovation).
