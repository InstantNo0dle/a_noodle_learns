# Wang Anshi

He was the chief minister to **Emperor Shenzong** of the [[Song dynasty]], who realized the collapse of the dynasty was near and tried to reverse it by implementing radical reforms.

- Made cheap loans available
- Promoted irrigation projects
- Taxed landlord and scholarly classes (usually exempt)
- Attempted to reorganize education and change the examination system to promote analytical thinking as opposed to route memorization

The increase in resources and money was then used to train mercenary forces to replace the weary mostly-peasant armies.

Unfortunately, it was almost as if all his work was for nothing because as soon as Emperor Shenzong died, the next emperor favored the old system and [[Neo-Confucians]] reversed most of his reforms (big L... also kind of sad ðŸ˜¢ )
