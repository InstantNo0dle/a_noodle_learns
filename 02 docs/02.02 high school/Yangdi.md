# Yangdi

**Yangdi**, [[Wendi|Wendi]]'s son, was the second emperor.

He murdered Wendi to ascend, indicating military prowess already. He then extended the area of rule, pushing nomads back.

He put in a large effort and resources to improve Confucian education, wanted to promote scholar-gentry.
- Restored examination to regulate entrance to bureaucracy
- Detrimental to aristocrats and nomadic military commanders

However, he really loved spoiling himself by forcing peasants to build all sorts of structures -- palaces, canals, a new capital city (Luoyang), and a game park?! To add fuel to the fire, he led a series of unsuccessful wars to reconquer Korea. You can probably guess what happens next; yup, revolts! Eventually, he was assassinated in *618* by his own ministers.
