# Continental Margin
This is the portion of the seafloor that is directly **adjacent** to the landmass.

There are three parts:
1. **Continental shelf**: This is considered the flooded extension of the continent because the crust is [[Continental Crust]]. 
	- Its width varies with the extent of continental crust
2. **Continental slope**: This is the boundary between the continents and the deep-ocean basin
	- It is relatively steep extending from the edge of the continental shelf to the floor of the ocean
1. **Continental rise**: This is the gradual incline merged with the continental slope if there are no trenches.
	- Consists of a thick layer of sediments that moved from the continental shelf to the ocean floor
