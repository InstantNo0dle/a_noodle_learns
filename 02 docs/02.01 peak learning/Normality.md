# Normality

>[!info]+ Formal Definition
>Normality is the number of **equivalents** per liter of solution.

Two ways to calculate -- [[Molarity]] and equivalent weights.

## Molarity method
$$N = M \cdot n$$
- $M$ = [[Molarity]]
- $n$ is the number of protons per formula unit (for acids) or number of hydroxide ions per formula unit (for bases)
	- Only care about the "interesting part" aka just $H^+$ or $OH^-$
		- [[Van't Hoff factor]] views all ions

>[!example]+ Ex 1. Calculate the normality of a solution of $\ce {1.14M H2SO4}$.
>Here, $M$ is given: $M = 1.14$ 
>To get $n$, there are two protons, so $n = 2$.
>$N = 1.14 \cdot 2 = 2.8$.

## Equivalent weights
This method uses the definition of normality. There are various ways of writing it, but this is the way for acids and bases:
$$ N = \frac{number\ of\ ew}{L} $$
- $ew$ = equivalent weights
> [!definition]
1 equivalent weight is defined as the mass that yields 1 mole of $\ce {H^+}$

To apply the formula in a problem:
1. Take 1 mole of $\ce{H^+}$ and convert it to how much grams of substance
	- Write a conversion factor ($\ce{1 ew = x g}$)
1. Use the conversion factor and find the number of equivalent weights
2. Use definition

>[!example]+ Ex 2. What is the normality of a solution that contains $\ce{1.5g}$ of $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ dissolved in $\ce{850 mL}$?
