# Nebular Hypothesis
This states that the bodies of the solar system came from a rotating cloud called the *solar nebula*.

**Solar nebula** was made of:
- Hydrogen and helium atoms from the Big Bang
- Microscopic dust
- Grains of heavier elements from the [[Life Cycle of a Star]]

1. It began to contract 5 billion years ago from:
	- *Gravitational interactions* between particles
	- External force, like a shock wave from a supernova
2. Contracting nebula spun faster and faster, collapsing into a flat disk
	- Because inner gravitational force balanced with the external rotational force
	- **Protosun** at the center -- a large concentration of mass
3. Gravitational energy converted to *heat* and rising temperatures
	- Dust degraded to molecules
	- Atoms were excited
	- Further away (past Mars), particles remained encased with ices because of low temperatures
4. Formation of the Sun and decrease in gravitational heating
	- Particles with high melting points to condense with others 
		- Included metals that formed clumps
	- **Planetseminals** formed from collisions between clumps and eventually became inner planets
		- Non-incorporated clumps became **meteorites**
		- Had relatively high temperatures, couldn't accumulate lighter elements (helium, hydrogen)
	- Outer planets accumulated encased ice particles and lighter elements
