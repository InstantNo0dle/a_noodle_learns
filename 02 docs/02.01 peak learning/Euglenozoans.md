# Euglenozoans

The notable distinguishing feature of Euglenozoans is a **rod** (spiral or crystalline) inside each flagella.

Well-studied groups:
- Kinetoplastids
	- Have a large mitochondrion storing DNA called a **kinetoplast**
	- Clinically relevant in [[Chagas' disease]] - *Trypanosoma*
- Euglenids
	- They have a small opening at the end of the cell for two flagella to exit
	- Some are mixotrophs, performing photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight only
		- Eyespot "mirrors" light to light detector, which determines where the euglenid needs to go/be
