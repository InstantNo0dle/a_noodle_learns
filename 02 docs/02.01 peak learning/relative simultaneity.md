>[!tldr] Simultaneity of events is **relative** to the observer.

According to **Gallilean transformations**, if two events are simultaneous to an inertial observer, they are simultaneous to all inertial observers.

However, according to **special relativity**, this isn't true due to speed of light being *constant*.
- Consider a train example with two observers, one in the rest frame, and one on the ground. There are two events A and B (light hitting front of the train/back of train).
	- According to the observer in the train, the events are simultaneous, but on the ground, the events aren't.
		- The observer on the ground would say light hits the back of the train first because the back of the train appears to be moving *towards* the light
- **Gallilean relativity** would say the velocity of the light changes for the observer on the ground, so the events would be simultaneous to both observers.
