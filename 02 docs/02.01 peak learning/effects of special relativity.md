# effects of special relativity
In order to see these effects of the [[postulates of special relativity|postulates]], you need **large** and **fast** objects.
- Planes, trains, etc.

General definitions:
- **Event**: point in four dimensional space-time that happens at *one* **instant** of time at a given position in space
- **Simultaneity** is when an event happens at the same time according to a fixed observer

There are four effects:
1. [[relative simultaneity]]
2. [[rear-clock-ahead effect]]
3. [[time dilation]]
4. [[length contraction]]
- In these experiments, the notation $'$ denotes a measurement in regards to the *rest* frame

These effects are *not* from delays due to light travel time, but are what you get when you subtract all those delays from the results (already compensates for it).
