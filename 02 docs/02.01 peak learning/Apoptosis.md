# Apoptosis
This is programmed cell death, which injured or damaged cells use to protect surrounding cells from the same fate.

It can be activated by:
- Extracellular signal leading to a [[Cell Signaling|signal transduction pathway]] activating proteins and molecules responsible 
- Intracellular <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">irreversibly damaged DNA</mark> activating similar proteins
- Signals from the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">endoplasmic reticulum</mark> when there is excessive **misfolded** protein

General **Steps**:
1. DNA and organelles are fragmented
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Blebbing</mark>: Cell shrinks and becomes lobed (forms "blebs")
3. Packaging of the cell into vesicles to be engulfed and digested

In *C. elegans*:
- Apoptotic proteins are always around in the cell, just inactive; signal transduction pathway regulates activity
1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ced-9</mark> on the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as master regulator and as a "brake" in the absence of a signaling protein, but is inactivated once signal is recieved
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ced-4</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ced-3</mark> (a caspase) are activated 
3. Other **proteases** and **nucleases** are activated
4. Rest of general pathway

In humans and mammals:
- The mitochondrial proteins form **pores** in the outer mitochondrial membrane, causing leakage of other apoptotic proteins
	- This includes <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cytochrome c</mark>, a well known death factor, when released from the mitochondria

Clinically relevant for cancer and Alzheimer's:
- In Alzheimer's, the large aggregate of misfolded proteins in neurons activates apoptotic factors leading to loss of brain function.
