# Radiolarians

These have symmetrical internal skeletons made out of silica with pseudopodia radiating out from the body.

Prey (microorganisms) sticks to the pseudopodia, which are reinforced by microtubules and covered by a layer of cytoplasm. The cytoplasm engulfs the microorganisms and **cytoplasmic streaming** then circulates it to the main part of the body.

After radiolarians die, their skeletons sink to the ocean floor and accumulate an ooze (like [[Diatoms]] during a bloom).
