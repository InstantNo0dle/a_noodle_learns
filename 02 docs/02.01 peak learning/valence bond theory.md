# valence bond theory

This theory uses the **quantum model** of probabilistic electron clouds to describe covalent bonds in terms of [[Atomic orbitals]].
- It makes up for the flaws of the [[VSEPR model]], which is a *localized electron model*
- Gives a way to calculate bond angles and lengths (although very complicated)

[[hybridization]] is an extension of the theory.

## types of bonds

The **$\sigma$-bond** is formed by two atomic orbitals merging together *end-to-end*, known as **overlap**.
- Distinguished by being *cylindrically symmetrical* with no [[Atoms#^5db080|nodal planes]]
- It can happen between an any two orbitals (s to s, s to p, etc.)
- All **single covalent bonds** are $\sigma$ bonds

The **$\pi$-bond** is formed by orbitals merging together *side-by-side*.
- It has one [[Atoms#^5db080|nodal plane]] along the internuclear axis
- Formed between p orbitals that are "left over" after $\sigma$ bond is formed.

$\sigma$ bonds are stronger than $\pi$ bonds.
- $\pi$ bonds have less overlap

The rule for determining the number of $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonds based on how many bonds (double, triple, etc) is:
- There is only 1 $\sigma$ bond that can form (between s orbital and one other)
- Remaining bonds are $\pi$ bonds
