# Photorespiration
This occurs as a result of the closing of stomata in **hot** and **dry** weather leading to *decreased* $CO_2$ levels.

As $CO_2$ levels decrease in the leaf, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">RuBisCo</mark> is capable of binding to $O_2$ and use that for the [[Calvin Cycle]] instead.
- When $O_2$ is fed into the cycle, a *two*-carbon product is released instead of G3P
	- This product is processed by **peroxisomes** and the **mitochondria** and ultimately leads to production of $CO_2$

Photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output:
- It uses ATP but doesn't produce sugar
- It releases $CO_2$ that would've been fixed

It is thought to be an **evolutionary relic** from the ancestors of common-day plants.
- The ancient atmosphere had very little oxygen and more $CO_2$ than today, so photorespiration wouldn't have made much of a difference

Photorespiration does have a benefit in being **photoprotective**:
- It may "*neutralize*" the products of light reactions that build up in the absence of the Calvin cycle.

Some plants have evolved alternate mechanisms of carbon fixation that try to *minimize* photorespiration:
- [[C4 Plants]]
- [[CAM Plants]]
