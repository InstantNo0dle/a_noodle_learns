# Foucault's Pendulum
This is a proof, proposed by Jean Foucault, that the Earth rotates.
- **Copernicus** believed this theory as well, but was unable to prove it

He suspended a long pendulum from the dome of the Pantheon in Paris and observed its oscillation throughout the day.
- A pendulum continues to swing in the same plane unless it's acted upon by an external force
- He noticed that the pendulum was *continuously* changing its position until 24 hours later, it returned to its starting position
	- Thus, it was acted on by an external force (the Earth's rotation)
