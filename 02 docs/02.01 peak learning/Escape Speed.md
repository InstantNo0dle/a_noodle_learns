# Escape Speed
A particle can escape from earth's gravity when its kinetic energy is larger than the gravitational potential energy.

Escape speed is when those two values are equal.
Once a particle reaches escape speed, it just goes into space, but doesn't orbit the earth, which happens when a particle reaches [[Orbital Velocity]].
