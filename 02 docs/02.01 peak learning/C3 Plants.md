# C3 Plants
C3 plants are named because the first product of [[Calvin Cycle#^28e4ec|carbon fixation]] is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">3-phosphoglycerate</mark>.

In these plants, the initial fixation of carbon is through <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">RuBisCo</mark> adding $CO_2$ to RuBP.
- Because of this, they suffer from [[Photorespiration]] siphoning as much as **50%** of the carbon fixed by the [[Calvin Cycle]].
