# Angular Velocity
**Average angular velocity** is the change in [[Angular Position]] over a time interval:
$$
\omega_{avg} = \frac{\theta_2-\theta_1}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

**Instantaneous angular velocity** is the *limit* of the average angular velocity as $\Delta t$ approaches 0.
$$
\omega = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

Both equations hold not only for one particle (the measured one) of the rigid body, but **all**, because they are "*locked*" together.

To determine the ***direction*** of an angular velocity vector, use the **right hand rule**:
1. Curl your hand around the axis of rotation
2. Have your fingers point *in the direction* of the rotation
3. Your *thumb* should point in the direction of the angular velocity vector
- [[Angular Acceleration]] direction can also be found this way
