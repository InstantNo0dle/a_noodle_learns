# Oxidation states

Patterns (inorganic)
- Fluorine is always 1-
- Oxygen is always 2- 
	- Unless with fluorine or as peroxide/superoxide
- Halogens are always 1-
	- Unless with oxygen or themself
- Group 1 always 1+
- Group 2 always 2+

Compounds can have multiple oxidation states of the same element.

For organic compounds, it's just about electronegativity.
- Only to keep track of redox -- bookeeping
