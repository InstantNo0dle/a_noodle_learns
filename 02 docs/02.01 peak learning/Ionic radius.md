# Ionic radius

>[!info]+ Definition
>Ionic radius is how an element shares distances with other neighboring ions in an ionic solid.

**Cations** are smaller than parent atoms because as electrons are lost, there is increased [[Effective nuclear charge]] from decreased **shielding**.

**Anions**, on the other hand, are larger than parent atoms because of increased **repulsive charges** as more electrons are added.

Atoms that have the same number of electrons are **isoelectronic** but they have different ionic radii.
- The one that will have the smallest radius is the one who has the greatest nuclear charge and vice versa.
