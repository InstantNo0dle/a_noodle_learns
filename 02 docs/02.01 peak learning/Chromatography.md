# Chromatography

This separates liquids from liquids by **adsorption** ability.

There are two phases:
- Stationary phase: solid to put liquids on
- Mobile phase: solvent that washes over

Usually calculate $R_f$ which is retardation/retention factor:
$$
R_f = \frac{distance\ travelled\ by\ solute}{distance\ travelled\ by\ solvent}
$$
- For the same setup/system, the compounds should have the same $R_f$ every time chromatography is
