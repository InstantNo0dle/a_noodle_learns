# Friction
There is friction present when a force acts on a [[Smooth Rolling]] system to change the object's speed.
- The force causes acceleration of the center of mass (translational) and speeds/slows rotation, thus also affecting the angular acceleration
	- These tend to make the object **slide**, so there is a frictional force acting to oppose it (the direction of the sliding)

Smooth rolling only occurs when the object *doesn't* slide, so the frictional force is **static** ($\vec f_s$).
-  In this case, the acceleration $a_{com}$ can be calculated by differentiating the [[Smooth Rolling#^7fddfe|Linear velocity for smooth rolling]] equation
$$
a_{com} = \alpha R
$$

If the object *does* slide, it isn't smooth rolling anymore and the frictional force is **kinetic** ($\vec f_k$).

> If the object slides because of the applied force, **none** of the smooth rolling equations can be used!
