Similar to the [[Earth's Rotation]], there are two types of "months":

**Synodic month**: This is the *apparent* period of the Moon's revolution, *29.5* days
- The time it takes for the Moon to go through its phases and reach its starting position

**Sidereal month**: This is the Moon's *true* period, *27.3* days
- The time it takes for the Moon to complete one full revolution around the Earth

The disparity is because while the Moon revolves around the Earth, the Earth is *continuing to revolve* around the Sun also, so it takes the Moon around 2 extra days to reach its starting position.

The Moon takes the same number of days to **rotate** as a sidereal month, meaning that the Earth has only ever seen one side.
- This also means that one side of the Moon experiences scorching hot temperatures while the other side is frigid
