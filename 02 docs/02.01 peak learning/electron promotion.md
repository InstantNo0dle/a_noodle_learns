# electron promotion

>If there are unoccupied **p-orbitals** in the electron configuration of an element, it may be able to form more bonds than predicted just by the configuration.

This can happen because one s-orbital electron can be "promoted" to the a higher energy orbital -- an empty p-orbital, making the molecule have 2 extra unpaired electrons!
- This "promotion" allows the promoted electron to experience less repulsion than before

**Carbon** is a notable example:
