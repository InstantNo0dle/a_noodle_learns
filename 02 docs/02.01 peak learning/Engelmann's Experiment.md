# Engelmann's Experiment
Engelmann, in 1833, used **bacteria** to measure rates of photosynthesis in filamentous algae.

**Steps**:
1. Exposure of algae to light passed through a prism
2. Application of aerobic bacteria
	- These concentrate near oxygen sources -- if some regions of algae were more productive (due to light wavelength), there would be *more* bacteria
3. Measure distribution of bacteria
