# Linear Velocity
The linear **speed** of a **rotating rigid body** can be found by differentiating the equation for [[Linear Displacement]] (rotational one):
$$\begin{align}
\frac{ds}{dt} =\frac{d\theta}{dt}r \\
\therefore v = \omega r
\end{align}
$$

- All points in the rigid body have the same angular speed $\omega$, so the linear speed depends on the **radius**

Every point in the rigid body undergoes **uniform circular motion** when the angular speed is *constant* (thus linear speed is also constant).
- The **period of revolution** is:
	- $$
	T=\frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
	  $$
