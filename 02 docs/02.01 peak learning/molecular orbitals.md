# molecular orbitals
Electrons occupy **molecular orbitals** that are spread around the *whole molecule* (delocalized) and not confined to bonds.
- Formed by a **linear combination of molecular orbitals** (LCAO) ^ba99c7
	- This is a sum of wavefunctions (of the [[Atomic orbitals]])
	- LCAO-MO: molecular orbital formed from atomic orbitals on different atoms

**Bonding orbitals** result from two atomic orbitals linearly combining *constructively* so that an electron occupying the molecular orbital has *lower* energy than in each atomic orbital alone.

**Antibonding orbitals** are from two atomic orbitals combining *destructively* so an electron has *higher* energy in it than in atomic orbitals alone.

For each bonding orbital, there is an antibonding orbital.
- $n$ atomic orbitals make $n$ molecular orbitals

**Molecular orbital energy-level diagram** shows relative energies of bonding and antibonding MOs. ^ef56ab
