# Action Spectrum
An **action spectrum** compares the productivity/photosynthetic rate of the chloroplast between different wavelengths of radiation.
- [[Engelmann's Experiment|Engelmann]] was the first to make one

**Steps**:
1. Shine light of different colors on chloroplasts
2. Plot wavelengths (of the light shone) against measures of photosynthetic rate
	- Include $CO_2$ consumption, $O_2$ production
