# Pascal's Law
```ad-important
title: Law

The pressure applied to an **enclosed fluid** is exerted to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the container.
```
Using the definitional formula of [[Pressure]]:
$$F_2 = \frac{A_2}{A_1}F_1$$

- This is powerful, as it can create an *amplifying* effect on the force exerted, depending on the surface area of the second piston.
