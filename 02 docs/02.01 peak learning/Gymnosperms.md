# Gymnosperms

The main distinguishing factor between gymnosperms and [[Angiosperms]] is *where* the seeds are.
- Gymnosperms have "naked" seeds that grow exposed on [[Sporophyll|sporophylls]] that become **cones**. Most gymnosperms are like this and are called **conifers**.
	- They have both **ovulate** (large) and **pollen** (small) cones

There are four phyla classified as gymnosperms:
- [[Cycadophyta]]
- [[Ginkgophyta]]
- [[Gnetophyta]]
- [[Coniferophyta]]

## Life cycle
1. Microsporocyte undergoes meiosis to produce microspores that are enveloped in a wall
2. When a [[Pollen grain]] reaches the ovule, it starts to "eat" away at the megasporangium and form a pollen tube
3. Megasporocyte undergoes **meiosis** to become four daughter cells, one of which will be the megaspore
4. Megaspore develops into a female gametophyte with multiple archegonia producing one egg each
5. **Fertilization**, which happens a very *long* time after pollination
	- Think about it like dating! (Generally also takes a while? I think ðŸ¤”)
6. Zygote develops into an embryo and ovule becomes a seed
