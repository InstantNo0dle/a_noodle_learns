The linear **distance** a point within the body moves along a circular arc is:
$$
s = \theta r
$$
- $\theta$ is the angle the [[Reference Line]] on a rigid body rotates through
- $r$ is the position the point is in from the axis of rotation
- Equation easily derived from the one for [[Angular Position]]
