This was the perspective the *early* ancient **Greeks** held on the universe.

The Earth was a *stationary* sphere in the **center** of the universe that was orbited by the Sun, Moon, and the known planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn):
- They believed that the Sun and the Moon were crystal spheres
- Beyond the Earth was the **celestial sphere**, a transparent sphere with **stars** attached that rotated daily around the Earth
- Actually, some Greeks knew that all the observed phenomena could be explained by a rotating Earth, but thought the Earth was too big
