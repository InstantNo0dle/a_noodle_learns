# Solution chemistry

Many reactions happen in a solution state because:
- Faster reaction -- already dispersed in the solution
- Easier to weigh out in small quantities -- stock solution
- Solvent (most commonly water) can participate in a reaction
	- Water in acid-base reactions
	- Hydration shell

[[Measures of concentration|Concentration units]] are of upmost importance because they are the main units used in solution chemistry.

**Solution energetics**:
1. Breaking solvent-solvent interactions, denoted $\Delta H_1$
2. Breaking solute-solute interactions, $\Delta H_2$
3. Forming solvent-solute interactions, $\Delta H_3$

Always consider whether the solution is **exothermic** or **endothermic**.

Also conductivity of solution -- electrolytes can conduct current

Applications IRL (in the lab): Making solutions
Use a volumetric flask
- Has one line to measure one amount very accurately
- Neck is so thin so that adding more solvent will make the level go up alot but actual volume doesn't increase by that much
1. Weigh out amount of solute
2. Add solute to flask
3. Add water
	- Make sure you add not as much as you need (slightly less)
		- Because solutions can expand/shrink
4. Shake it
5. Once it settles, add more water until you have desired amount

IMPORTANT! [[Separation techniques]]
