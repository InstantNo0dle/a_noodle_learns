# Apicomplexans

These are universal parasites for animals -- almost all animal species are attacked.

They spread through hosts as **sporozoites** (small infectious cells). At one apex, there is a complex of organelles to help penetrate host cells and tissues -- thus api/complex/an. 
- They aren't photosynthetic but retain a plastid called an apicoplast.

They have complex life cycles that often take multiple hosts to complete. 
- *[[Plasmodium]]*, the apicomplexan that causes malaria, lives in both mosquitoes (mainly *Anapheles*) and humans.
