# Diatoms

These are **algae** that have glass-like cell walls made of silicon dioxide in an organic matrix.
- Comes in two parts, like a lid and a box
- To provide resistance against pressure
- Walls accumulate in sediments called **diatomaceous earth**

> Diatoms are ***good***: The $CO_2$ used by diatoms for photosynthesis is pumped to the ocean floor, therefore **lowering** atmospheric $CO_2$.

Because they are so widespread, their growth affects global $CO_2$ levels. When there is an abundance of nutrients, they grow rapidly -- **bloom**. This bloom leads to too many diatoms for predators to eat, and when uneaten diatoms die, their bodies sink down to the ocean floor (which takes a long time). So, instead of the carbon in the diatoms' bodies immediately being released as $CO_2$ by decomposers, it remains there.
