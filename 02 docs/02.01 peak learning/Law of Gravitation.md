# Law of Gravitation
```ad-important 
title: Law
For any particle, it attracts other particles with a force that is **directly proportional** to the product of the masses and **inversely proportional** to the square of the distance.

```
It was proposed by **Newton**:
$$ F_g = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
- G (big G) is the **gravitational constant:** $$G=6.67 \times 10^{-11} N \cdot m^2/kg^2$$

Little g, which is the gravitational acceleration that is used in 1D kinematics is derived from big G:
$$g=G\frac{M_E}{R^2}$$
- Assuming that Earth is a perfectly round sphere and has uniform mass
	$$M_E = 5.97 \times 10^{24} kg, R=6.38 \times 10^6 m$$
- In reality, little g *varies* from place to place because of those assumptions and **centripetal acceleration** due to Earth's rotation

From this law, Newton realized that the **orbit** is determined by the planet's **gravitational "pull"** to the sun and its **"forward" motion**.
- However, it is slightly affected by **perturbations** -- the effect of other celestial bodies on the planet
	- This concept led to the discovery of **Neptune**
