# Atomic radius

Although electrons clouds don't have definite boundaries, when packed into solids and bonded together, the centers of atoms do.

>[!info] Atomic radius is **half** the distance between one atomic center and a neighboring atomic center.

For metals, you can find it by using the definition on a **solid** sample. 

For nonmetals and metalloids, you find it by taking apply the definition to atoms chemically bonded together --**covalent radius**.

For noble gases, the **van der Waals radius** is used instead: Apply definition to a sample of *solidified* gas.

For ionic solids, the [[Ionic radius]] is markedly different than the atomic radius. 

A trend seen for this property in the periodic table is:
- *Increases* as you move *down* a **group**
	- Higher [[Principal quantum number]]s as you move down, so further from the nucleus + larger
- *Decreases* as you move *across* a **period**
	- Increasing [[Effective nuclear charge]] because number of protons increase with number of electrons but electrons occupy the same shell (same distance away) and don't **shield** well
