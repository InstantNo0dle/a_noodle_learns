# Atoms

Many important properties of atoms were discovered in the simplest element, the **hydrogen** atom.
- [[Principal quantum number]]
	- Ground state
- [[Atomic orbitals]]
	- [[Spherical polar coordinates]]
	- Radial wavefunction
		- Bohr radius
	- Angular wavefunction
	- Three quantum numbers
		- $n$, aka [[Principal quantum number]]
			- Shells
				- Orbitals with the same [[Principal quantum number]] and energy belong to the same shell
		- $l$, aka [[Orbital angular momentum quantum number]]
			- Subshells
				- s-orbital
				- p-orbital
				- d-orbital
				- f-orbital
			- Orbital angular momentum
		- $m_l$, aka [[Magnetic quantum number]]

	- [[Radial distribution function]]
	- Boundary surface is usually drawn instead of a cloud
		- Nodal plane is where electrons can never be ^5db080
- [[Electron spin]] ($m_s$)
	- Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)

These properties of the hydrogen atom can be extended to **many-electron** atoms.
- Orbital energies
	- [[Effective nuclear charge]]
- Building-up principle (**Aufbau**) ^511f07
	- [[Pauli exclusion principle]]
	- [[Hund's rule]]

There are trends for the properties of atoms described above, organized on the periodic table.
- [[Atomic radius]]
	- Covalent radius
	- Van der waals radius
- [[Ionic radius]]
- [[Ionization energy]]
- [[Electron affinities]]
- Inert-pair effect
