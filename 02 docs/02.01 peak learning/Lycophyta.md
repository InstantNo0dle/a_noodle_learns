# Lycophyta

This phylum used to be dominated by very tall species (giant trees) around the **Carboniferous** period when the climate was more humid, but by the **Permian** period when the climate became drier, many went extinct. Now, all extant lycophytes are small herbaceous plants.

Many of them are **epiphytes**, growing on other trees (not as parasites).

It consists of:
- **Club mosses**
	-  Have [[Sporophyll#^957928|strobilli]]
	- [[Sporophyll#^4b0ab8|Homosporous]]
	- Magicians used to create smoke because spores are have a lot of oil and are released in a cloud
