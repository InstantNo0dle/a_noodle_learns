These are the tall ones with a wide ranging spectrum from < 1mm to 60 cm! 

*Polytrichum* (hairy-cap moss) and relatives have more complex "[[Leaves]]" with ridges and a covering of cuticle.

Sporophytes are tall too, ~ 20 cm and turn brown/red when ready to release their spores.

*Sphagnum*, aka peat moss is important economically and ecologically. It doesn't decay quickly because of phenolic compounds in its cell walls, and is thus a carbon sink. However, there is overharvesting of *Sphagnum* which contributes to global warming by now releasing that store. This global warming sets off a positive feedback loop:
1. Water levels of peatlands drops
2. Peat decomposes in dry air to release even more $CO_2$ and cause even more global warming
