A photosystem is embedded into the **thylakoid membrane** and consists of **light-harvesting complexes** and a **reaction center complex**.

**Light harvesting complexes** act like antennae for the **reaction center complex**:
- They contain accessory pigments like [[Chlorophyll b]] and [[Carotenoids]] bound to proteins
	- This enables harvesting of light over a greater surface area and over a greater [[Absorption Spectrum]]
- The pigments absorb photons and pass the [[Absorption Spectrum#^1e2327|energy]] released to the next pigment, until it passes into the reaction center complex

The **reaction center complex** contains a pair of [[Chlorophyll a]] molecules and a **primary electron acceptor** capable of being reduced and accepting the electrons.
- When the energy is passed to the chlorophyll a molecules, one electron is able to be excited to a higher energy level
	- This electron is passed to the **primary electron acceptor** in a redox reaction

There are two types, named in their order of discovery:
- [[Photosystem I]]
- [[Photosystem II]]
