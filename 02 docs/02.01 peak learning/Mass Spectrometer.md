This is the most **accurate** machinery to compare masses of atoms.

Steps:
1. A sample of molecules or atoms are passed into an electron beam
	- This strips the electrons off the atoms and makes them **posititvely** charged
2. An electric field is applied to accelerate the ions to a magnetic field
	- Charged ions have their own magnetic field, so interaction with the other magnetic field causes a *change in path direction*, which depends on mass
		- Most massive ions are deflected the least
3. Separated ions' positions for where the ions hit the detector can be used to deduce masses
