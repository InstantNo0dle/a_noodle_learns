# Stable Platform
These are regions of highly deformed rocks (like [[Shield|shields]]) covered with a thin layer of **sedimentary rocks**.
- The rocks are almost horizontal except for places where they've been warped by wind or other elements to form structures like domes and basins

A vast region of stable platform is between the **Canadian Shield** and the **Rocky Mountains**, in North America.
