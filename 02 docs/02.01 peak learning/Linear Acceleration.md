# Linear Acceleration
Linear acceleration can be found by differentiating the equation for [[Linear Velocity]] (rotational, actually linear speed):
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{d\omega}{dt}r \\
\therefore a_t = \alpha r
\end{align}
$$
- This equation finds the **tangential** component of $a$, since that is the component responsible for changing the *magnitude* of linear velocity

- To find the **radial** component of $a$, which is responsible for changes in the *direction* of linear velocity use the standard equation:
	- $$
	a_r = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r
	$$

When the **angular velocity** of the body isn't 0, there is a **radial** component of acceleration; when the **angular acceleration** isn't 0, there is a **tangential** component.
