Cholera is a lethal disease that is caused by the bacteria *Vibro cholerae* in water contaminated by human feces.

The bacteria form a [[Quorum Sensing#^19a276|biofilm]] that secrete the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cholera toxin</mark>.

The toxin chemically modifies the [[G-Protein Coupled Receptors#^4f679b|G protein]] involved with <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">salt</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">water</mark> secretion in intestinal cells:
- The modified G protein is unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, so it is eternally in an "on" state, always **activating** adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to [[cAMP]]
- The high concentration of cAMP continuously causes the intestinal cells to **secrete** a lot of salts (and via osmosis, water too), causing <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">diarrhea</mark> and possible death from loss of fluids
