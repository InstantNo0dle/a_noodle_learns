Measure the **length** of the train in the rest frame and ground frame by emitting light to a mirror (time difference).

Two events:
- Event A: flash of light is emitted
- Event B: reflected light comes back to the emitter

The observer inside the train thinks the time is: $t'_{AB} = \frac{2L'}{c}$

The observer on the ground thinks the duration of the forward trip is *different* from the backward trip (back to emitter).
- Forward trip, mirror is moving "away" from the emitter
- Backward trip, velocities are moving towards each other

- So the total time is $\Delta t_{AB} = \frac{L}{c+v} + \frac{L}{c-v} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2-v^2}$

Major assumption: [[perpendicular length contraction is conserved]].

Using the results of the [[time dilation]] effect, you can find the lengths:
$$\Delta t_{AB} = \gamma \Delta t'_{AB}$$
- It can be used because the events still happen in the *same position* according to the observer!

Substituting yields:
$$L = \frac{L'}{\gamma}$$
