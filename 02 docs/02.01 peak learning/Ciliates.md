# Ciliates

Most ciliates are predators that use their cilia to move and hunt.

They all have two types of nuclei, small micronuclei and large macronuclei, with each cell having more than one of each type.

They reproduce via **binary fission** where the macronuclei disintegrates and new ones are formed from the micronuclei.
- Genetic variation is through **conjugation**, where two ciliates swap haploid micronuclei
