# cAMP
cAMP is **cyclic adenosine monophosphate** (AMP).

It is produced from <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ATP</mark> via <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">adenylyl cyclase</mark> in response to an extracellular signal (e.g. epinephrine, in [[Sutherland's Experiments]]):
1. Epinephrine (or an extracellular signal) binds to a [[G-Protein Coupled Receptors|GPCR]]
2. A G-protein is activated, which activates adenylyl cyclase
3. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Adenylyl cyclase</mark> catalyzes synthesis of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">cAMP</mark>
- Through this, the concentration of cAMP can be amplified very quickly in the cytoplasm

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Phosphodiesterase</mark> quickly converts <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cAMP</mark> to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">AMP</mark> , so more epinephrine needs to bind in order to sustain the surge in cAMP.

The cellular response to the increased concentration of cAMP is likely due to the effect of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">protein kinase A</mark> , which phosphorylates various proteins downstream in the cascade.
