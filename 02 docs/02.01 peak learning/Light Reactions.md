They take place in the thylakoid to convert **solar energy** into **chemical energy** by storing the energy in $NADP^+$ and ATP.

1. Water is split by light into electrons and protons
2. Electrons and protons are stored and transferred to $NADP^+$ to form NADPH
	- NADPH acts as *reducing* power, a source of electrons
3. [[Chemiosmosis#Photosynthesis|chemiosmosis]] of protons leads to **photophosphorylation** of ADP to ATP
