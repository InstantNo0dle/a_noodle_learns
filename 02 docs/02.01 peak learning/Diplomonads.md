# Diplomonads

These protists, along with [[Parabasalids]] lack plastids and have greatly reduced mitochondria.

Diplomonads' greatly reduced mitochondria are called **mitosomes**:
- Lack electron transport chain so must do things anaerobically

Many are parasites, including *Giardia intestinalis*.

They are **binuclear**, with two equal sized nuclei and multiple flagella.
