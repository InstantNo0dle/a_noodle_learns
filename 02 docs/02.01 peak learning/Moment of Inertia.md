# Moment of Inertia
This quantity expresses how the *mass* of the rotating rigid body is **distributed** along the *axis of rotation*.
>[!danger]
>The **axis of rotation** must be specified, or else the moment of inertia is meaningless.

$$ 
I = \sum m_ir_i^2
$$
- This equation can be extended to continuous number of particles through **integrating** it:
	- $$
	I = \int r^2dm
	$$

A *shortcut* for find this is the [[Parallel Axis Theorem]].

Using the integrated formula, here are some common moment of inertias for differently shaped objects:
