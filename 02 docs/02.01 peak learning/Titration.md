# Titration

These come in two flavors: acid-base titrations or redox titrations.

In both, you have two solutions with the reactants to produce a complete reaction. You know the *volume* of one solution (**analyte**) and the *concentration* of the other (**titrant**).
1. Use a volumetric pipet to transfer a known volume of the analyte to a flask
2. Slowly put the titrant into the flask using a buret until all the analyte has reacted
3. The initial and final volumes can be used to determine the concentration

You also need an indicator (usually a water-soluble dye) that detects the **stoichiometric point** -- the point where just enough titrant is added that is needed by the reaction.
- **Phenolphthalein** is initially *colorless* (in acidic reaction) but suddenly turns *pink* when too much base is present (after stoichiometric point is passed)
