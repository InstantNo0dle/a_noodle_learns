# Cyclic Electron Flow
This alternate electron flow from [[Linear Electron Flow]] only uses [[Photosystem I]].

Instead of going on to produce NADPH from the **primary electron acceptor** of photosystem I, electrons are **cycled**:
1. Electrons are passed to ferredoxin (Fd)
2. Fd passes to the **cytochrome complex** of the *first* [[Electron Transport Chain#Chloroplast|ETC]] and continues through it back to photosystem I

In the end, **ATP** is produced, but NADPH isn't.

Some organisms, like **photosynthetic bacteria** (purple and green sulfur) only have PSI, so the only means of generating ATP through photosynthesis is using cyclic electron flow.

It has been hypothesized that cyclic electron flow is **photoprotective**, and thus *beneficial* for plants with both photosystems too.
