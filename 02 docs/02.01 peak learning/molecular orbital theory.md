This theory is another quantum-based one that overcomes the problems with [[valence bond theory]] and [[VSEPR model|vsepr]].

## problems with previous theories
Main problem is *magnetism* (indeed a real word) of **oxygen**:
- **Diamagnetic** substance: moves out of a magnetic field
	- All electrons are paired
- **Paramagnetic** substance: moves into a magnetic field
	- Presence of unpaired electrons
- Other theories say $O_2$ is diamagnetic, but it's actually paramagnetic! ðŸ¤¯
	- Magneticism detected by:
		- [[gouy balance]]
		- **superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)**

They also cannot accurately predict the structure of **electron-deficient compounds** (like boranes).
- These are compounds that have too few valence electron to write a valid Lewis structure.

## [[molecular orbitals]]
## applications
To describe *diatomic* molecules using this theory: ^b6a400
1. Find the *total* number of valence electrons for the molecule
2. Draw a [[molecular orbitals#^ef56ab|molecular orbital energy-level diagram]] based on the atomic orbitals present
	- Start with $\sigma$-orbital first for each **subshell**, then $\pi$-orbitals
		- There are *two* $\pi$-orbitals formed from the 2p subshell (three M.Os can form in total, one is $\sigma$-orbital)
> [!important]
> For period 2 elements up until **nitrogen**, $\sigma_{2p}$ lies *above* $\pi_{2p}$.
> - For these elements, think about it as building 4 molecular orbitals from 4 atomic orbitals (not 2 sets) because they are so similar in energy -- determined by [[photoelectron spectroscopy|PES]].
> 
**Oxygen** and **fluorine** have it reversed, because they have many electrons contributing to shielding.

3. Populate the valence electrons in the molecular orbitals
	- The same rules used in the [[Atoms#^511f07|building up principle]] apply
	- Even a single electron can bond atoms together (not required for bonding)

If not homonuclear, don't worry! I gotchu ðŸ’™:
- [[m.o. theory on heteronuclear diatomic molecules]]
- polyatomic molecules are much, much more complex ðŸ˜“

To determine [[bond order]] using this theory:
$$b = \frac{1}{2} \times (N_e - N_e^*)$$

>[!warning]
>When writing the electron configuration using M.O. theory, if electrons are unpaired, write them separately!

- This is how molecules can be predicted to be **paramagnetic**
