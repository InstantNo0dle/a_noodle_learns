# Spherical polar coordinates

These are coordinates used to express the location of each point around the nucleus. There are three $r, \theta, \phi$.

- $r$ is the distance from the nucleus (think "radius")
- $\theta$ is the angle from the +z axis (think "latitude")
	- Actually called the co-latitude since its measured from the north pole (regular latitude measured from the equator)
- $\phi$ is the angle from the x axis or about the z axis (think "longitude")
