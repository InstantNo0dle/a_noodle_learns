# Reaction writing

General roadmap:
1. Write formulas for reactants
2. Ask "are there pieces that can break apart when dissolved in water"?
	- [[Solution chemistry#^a111a8|Solubility rules]]
3. Ask how the reactants interact?
	- Binary compound reactions are often double replacement, may form precipitate

General writing depends on types of reaction:
Molecular
- Keep all compounds as molecules
Ionic
- Write in terms of ions if dissolves
- If insoluble, don't write in terms of ions
Net ionic reaction
- Eliminate spectator ions -- ions both in reactants and products
- Only reagents that are *changing*

Types (classification):
1. Memorize
	- [[Decomposition reactions]]
	- Misc reactions (no pattern)
2. Reactions w/o oxidation state change
	- [[Double displacement gas evolution reactions]]
		- Or precipitation
	- [[Acid-base reactions]]
		- Anhydrous acids from **nonmetal** oxides
		- Anhydrous bases from **metal** oxides
	- [[Lewis acid-base reactions]]
3. Reactions with [[Oxidation state]] change
	- [[Combustion reactions]]
	- [[Single displacement reactions]]
		- [[Nitric acid reactions]]
	- [[Redox reactions]]
4. Organic reactions
5. [[Radioactive decay]]
