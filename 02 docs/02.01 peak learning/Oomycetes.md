# Oomycetes

The group includes water molds, downy mildews, and white rusts.

These were originally classified as fungi due to presence of multicellular filaments resembling fungi hyphae.

However, a key difference is that cell walls are made out of cellulose instead of chitin.

They descended from an organism that had plastids, but they don't perform photosynthesis nor have them. Instead, they are either **parasites** on [[Plants]] or are decomposers.
