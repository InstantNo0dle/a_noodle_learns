# Protein Phosphorylation
Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate groups to a molecule to alter/influence its activity.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Protein kinase</mark> is an enzyme that is often involved in phosphorylation reactions to transfer the phosphate groups.
- Most phosphorylate <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">serine</mark> or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">threonine</mark> residues
- Multiple can be combined to form a **phosphorylation cascade**
- Phosphorylation, most of the time, *increases* activity of the protein

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Protein phosphatase</mark> is the counterpart of protein kinase, involved in dephosphorylation reactions.
- Acts to recycle protein kinase (by inactivating it) and as an "off" switch for the cascade
- Dephosphorylation, most of the time, *decreases* activity of the protein
