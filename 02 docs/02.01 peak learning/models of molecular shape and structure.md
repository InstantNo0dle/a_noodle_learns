1. The [[VSEPR model]] portrays the three-dimensional organization of Lewis structures in space.
2. The [[valence bond theory]] improves upon the vsepr model by describing bonding in terms of atomic orbitals
3. The [[molecular orbital theory]] is the most accurate, fixing problems with the two Lewis-based models such as magnetism. It describes electrons as being de localized instead of "belonging" to any one atom.
