# Cell Signaling
Inspired/based off [[Sutherland's Experiments]], there are three big steps:
1. ***Reception***: Detection of the signaling molecule
	- Usually by **binding** of a signaling molecule to a receptor protein, causing it to change shape
		- [[G-Protein Coupled Receptors]]
		- [[Receptor Tyrosine Kinases]]
		- Ion Channel Receptors
	- Receptor proteins' shape are hard to study via *X-ray crystallography* because they are **flexible** and **unstable** (hard to crystallize)
2. ***Transduction***: Conversion of the signal into something that can elicit a response -- usually **signal transduction pathway**
	- Often carried out in multiple steps which **amplifies** the signal and allows for more **regulation**
	- Most likely involves a shape change in the proteins involved, through [[Protein Phosphorylation]]
	- Also involves [[Second Messengers]]
3. ***Response***: Cellular response to the signal
	- It is often tightly [[Regulation of Response|regulated]]
