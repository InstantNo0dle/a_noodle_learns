This is how bacteria monitor the **local density** of cells.

Bacteria communicate via cell-to-cell signaling; by secreting molecules that can be detected by others.
- Bacteria sense the *concentration* of the secreted molecules -- quorum sensing.

Quorum sensing allows for bacteria to **coordinate** their behavior for activities where they may have to interact:
- Formation of a **biofilm**, which is an aggregate of bacterial cells on a surface ^19a276
- **Fruiting body**: If nutrients are scarce, bacteria can communicate to form such a structure, which releases resilient spores
