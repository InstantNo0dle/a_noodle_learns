# Electron spin

This was verified in an experiment carried out by **Stern** and **Gerlach**.
- They hypothesized that a spinning electron should behave like a magnet
- Used **silver** because of having one unpaired electron -- essentially behaves like a singular unpaired electron on something large
	- Sent through a **non-uniform magnetic field** that separated electrons into bands based on orientation of spin
	- Found two narrow bands, each representing one orientation of spin

This is the main idea behind **electron paramagnetic resonance**, which studies molecules and ions with unpaired electrons.
