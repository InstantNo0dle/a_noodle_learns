# Chagas' disease

Chagas' disease is also known as sleeping sickness.

It affects mostly people in Africa and is transmitted by the bite of the African tsetse fly. *Trypanosoma* is the agent of the disease, a [[Euglenozoans|Euglenozoan]].

*Trypanosoma* evades the immune system using a "bait 'n switch" tactic: ^37dfe7
- It is covered in many surface proteins
- Before the immune system can recognize the protein, new generations switch to a different protein with a different structure
