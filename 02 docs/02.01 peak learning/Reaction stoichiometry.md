# Reaction stoichiometry

>[!info]+ Definition
>This is the quantitative part of chemical reactions that can be used to predict the product from the reactants and how much reactant is needed, based on a **balanced chemical equation**.

Generally, a **mole ratio** needs to be created between the product and a reactant, using the coefficients of a the balanced chemical equation. It can then be used to predict the amount of both the products and reactants, given different information (in [[Moles]]). ^09fc10

## Mass-to-mass predictions
In these problems, a mass of a reactant/product is given and the task is to find how much mass of another reactant/product will be needed to react with it. 

1. Convert mass to moles
2. Use **mole ratio**
3. Convert back from moles to mass

## [[Volumetric analysis]]
The goal of this can predict the **concentration** and the **mass**.
