# FADH2
$FADH_2$ is another **electron carrier** like [[NADH]] for aerobic respiration.
- It produces around **1.5** ATP per molecule, less efficient than NADH because it donates electrons at a lower energy level
	- Instead of depositing its electrons in complex I of the [[Electron Transport Chain]], it does so in complex II
