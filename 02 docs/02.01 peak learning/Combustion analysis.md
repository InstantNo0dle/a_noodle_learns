This is a common technique used to determine the [[Empirical formula]] of an organic compound.

The process is as follows and makes use of the concept of a [[Limiting reactant]]:
1. Sample (of known mass) is burned in a tube with excess oxygen, which makes the sample the limiting reactant
2. All carbon becomes $\ce{CO_2}$ and all hydrogen becomes $\ce{H_2O}$. The gases are separated using **chromatography** and relative amounts are determined by measuring **thermal conductivity**.

You can determine the empirical formula if the sample only contains **carbon**, **hydrogen**, and **oxygen**.
- Since all the carbon is incorporated into $\ce{CO_2}$, the [[Moles]] of carbon in the sample can be stoichiometrically related
$$\ce{1 mol of C in sample \bumpeq 1 mol CO2}$$
- Similarly, this can be done for hydrogen
$$\ce{2 mol of H in sample \bumpeq 1 mol H2O}$$
- Oxygen can be calculated by finding the masses of carbon and hydrogen in the sample and subtracting those values from the mass of the sample

>[!example]+ M.4A When $\ce{0.528 g}$ of sucrose (a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) is burned, $\ce{0.306 g}$ of water and $\ce{0.815 g}$ of carbon dioxide are formed. Deduce the empirical formula of sucrose.
