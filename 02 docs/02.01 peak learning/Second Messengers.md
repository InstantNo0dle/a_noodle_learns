# Second Messengers
These are *non-protein* water-souble molecules or ions that can easily spread around the cell through **diffusion** to carry the signal.

They work because there are many **relay proteins** that react to changes in concentration of these second messengers in the cell.

Most common second messengers:
- [[cAMP]]
- [[Calcium Ions (IP3-DAG)]]
