# Mountain Belts
Mountain belts are made of relatively *young* mountains (< 100 million years old) are found mainly in two areas of the world:
- **Circum-Pacific** belt
- **Alps to Himalayas** belt
In mountain belts, the rocks are highly deformed and squished together.

*Older* mountains reside within continents and have shorter and flatter peaks because of **erosion**
- Appalachian Mountains in the U.S.
- Urals in Russia
