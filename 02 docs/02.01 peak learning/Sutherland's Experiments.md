# Sutherland's Experiments
Earl W. Sutherland won the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his research in how **epinephrine** stimulates breakdown of glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle cells.

He discovered that epinephrine activates **glycogen phosphorylase**, and ran experiments:
- He added epinephrine to a test-tube containing *only* glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen, and nothing happened
- However, when he added epinephrine to a test-tube containing an **intact cells**, glycogen breakdown did happen

This suggested that:
1. Epinephrine doesn't directly interact with glycogen phosphorylase; intermediate steps happen
2. Interaction with the plasma membrane is the key step

Sutherland also found that binding of epinephrine to the [[G-Protein Coupled Receptors|GPCR]] caused a cytosolic *increase* in the concentration of [[cAMP]].
