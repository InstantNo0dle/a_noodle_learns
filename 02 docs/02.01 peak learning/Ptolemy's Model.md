# Ptolemy's Model
This is a [[Geocentric View|geocentric]] model that took into account apparent **retrograde motion** by the planets "orbiting" the earth.
- When he observed the planets every night, he saw that they usually moved *eastward*, but periodically stopped and reversed direction for some time before moving eastward again.
	- The reversal of direction motion is the **retrograde motion**

**Retrograde motion** is now explained by the speed of the planets' orbits. 
- Earth orbits around the Sun faster than Mars, so once it overtakes Mars, it appears as if Mars is going backwards.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ptolemy</mark> was able to explain this by designing a system where:
- Planets orbited on **epicycles**; small circles
- The orbits of the planets revolved around the Earth in **deferents**; large circles
