# VSEPR model

**VESPR** = "*Valence-shell electron-pair repulsion*"

> [!caution] keep in mind!
> **Molecular arrangement** doesn't take into consideration lone pairs, but the **electron arrangement** does!

To make molecules easier to predict, the "**VSEPR formula**" can be used: $AX_nE_m$
- A = central atom
- X = attached atom
- E = lone pair

## the rules
Models of molecules can be predicted based on the effects of **electron-pair repulsion**. 
1. Electron pairs in **bonds** and **lone pairs** *repel* each other and move as far apart as possible while keeping the same distance from the central atom.
	- This optimal arrangement is called the **electron arrangement**
2. Single and multiple bonds are treated the same -- as one region of high electron concentration
3. Refer to the caution callout above; all regions of high electron density (including lone pairs) are included in electron arrangement, but only positions of actual [[Atoms]] are used in molecular arangement.
4. Strength of repulsions:
	1. Lone pair vs lone pair
	2. Lone pair vs atom
	3. Atom vs atom
	- This allows for prediction of where the lone pair is most likely to be found
		- **Axial** lone pair (a)
		- **Equatorial** lone pair (b)

## bond angles
Bond angles between molecules in the model are determined by **spectroscopy**.
- These angles are not set in stone; they vary greatly with the presence of lone pairs.
	- The presence of lone pairs push the [[Atoms]] bound to the central atom **closer** together because of its larger "sphere of influence"
- Take note of:
	- Trigonal planar: 120$\degree$
		- Ozone ($O_3$): 116.8$\degree$
		- Nitrite ion ($NO_2^-$): 116$\degree$
		- Sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$): 119.5$\degree$
	- Tetrahedral: 109.5$\degree$
	- Trigonal bipyramidal: 90$\degree$ and 120$\degree$
	- Pentagonal bipyramidal: 90$\degree$ and 72$\degree$

## applications
The general procedure is as follows:
1. Write Lewis structure to determine "blueprint"
	- Only draw lone pairs for the central atom!
2. Identify **electron arrangement**
3. Use actual atoms to identify **molecular arrangement**
4. Make sure lone pairs are far apart from each other and bonding atoms (consider axial vs equatorial placement of lone pairs)

VSEPR can also be used to predict the *polarity* of a **polyatomic** molecule because shape is the most important factor (polarity of bonds doesn't matter if they cancel out due to shape).
- But, the polarity of a diatomic molecule *is* determined by polarity of **bonds**
