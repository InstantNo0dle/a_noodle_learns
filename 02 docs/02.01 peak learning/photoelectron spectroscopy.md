The photoelectron spectrometer has a source of high frequency short wavelength radiation.
- UV for molecules
- X-rays for solids

The photons bombarding the sample have a high enough energy to be able to eject electrons from the molecular orbitals.

Photons are shot with a known frequency $\nu$ to eject an electron with energy $E_{orbital}$ and propel it to have kinetic energy $E_k$. 
- $E_k$ is determined by measuring the ejected electron's speed, similar to how a mass spectrometer does it
	- Magnetic field deflects electrons to land on a detector. Strength of magnetic field enables determining the speed.

The following expression can then be solved for $E_{orbital}$.
$$h\nu - E_{orbital} = E_k$$
