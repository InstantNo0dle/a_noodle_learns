# Pipets
There are two common types: volumetric and measuring.

><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Volumetric pipets</mark> can measure **one** volume of fluid accurately, while <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">measuring pipets</mark> can measure **many** volumes of fluid accurately.

**Volumetric** pipets are for transferring solutions, and come in different volumes, which are used depending on how much solution needs to be transferred.
- When filled to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">calibration mark</mark>, the amount of volume indicated on the pipet is tranferred

**Measuring** pipets are for measuring out specific quantities of solution that cannot be measured by volumetric pipets.
