# Coniferophyta
This is the *largest* gymnosperm phyla with a lot of variety.
- Cones vary in composition -- most are woody, but there are some fleshy and even just needle-like leaves!
- Widespread geographic location

Most are **evergreen**, with fully-developed leaves persisting through winter to spring where they can take advantage of all the sun.
