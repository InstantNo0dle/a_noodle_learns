# Slime molds

They are also called **mycetozoans** and were originally thought to be fungi because they produce fruiting bodies for spore dispersal (ended up being convergent evolution).

## Plasmodial slime molds

They have bright colors and form a mass called a plasmodium as they grow (which is *not* the same as [[Plasmodium]] the [[Apicomplexans|apicomplexan]]). 

Even though they can be quite big, it is just one many-many nucleated cell (supercell) that doesn't have separation by plasma membranes.

It "moves" by growing: it extends pseudopodia through the surface and engulfs any food particles it encounters, to keep growing. 

If the environment becomes stressed (no food/drying up), it will stop growing and become fruiting bodies for **sexual reproduction.**

## Cellular slime molds

They start out as individuals in the feeding stage, but once food is depleted, they aggregate into a *slug-like* structure to function as a unit. However, the cells remain separate with plasma membrane acting as dividers. In the end, they form an **asexual** fruiting body.

Life cycle:
1. Haploid feeding amoebas divide by mitosis every once in a while
2. Haploid amoebas fuse to become a zygote
3. Zygote **eats** other haploid amoebas to become very large (way to repay your debts!) and develops a tough wall
4. Zygote undergoes meiosis and then multiple rounds of mitosis
5. Wall breaks, releasing new amoebas
6. Many amoebas aggregate when food is depleted
7. The aggregate migrates like a slug
8. Some cells dehydrate and become a stalk supporting the fruiting body
9. Other cells climb up the stalk and develop into spores
10. Spores released
11. Amoebas will break out of the spores and feed, under favorable conditions

In *Dictyostelium discoideum*, some amoebas try to "cheat": They have mutations in a gene that allow them to never become part of the stalk and always contribute their genes. The mechanism discouraging cheating is the lack of a surface protein on such cells, which other non-cheating cells can identify. 
- Non-cheating cells try to only aggregate with other non-cheating cells, so the cheaters have less of a chance.
- Moral of the story: *Don't cheat, kids.*
