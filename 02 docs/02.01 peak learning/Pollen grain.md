# Pollen grain

A pollen grain is a male gametophyte enclosed in a pollen wall that is secreted by the sporophyte.

It produces a **pollen tube** (like a waterslide) that deposits the sperm into the female gametophyte inside the [[Ovule]].
- Enters ovule through opening in one end called the **micropyle**

This likely helped in colonizing dry habitats as male gametophytes no longer needed to rely on water for fertilization.
- Most [[Seed vascular plants]] lost flagella, except for a few gymnosperm species ([[Cycadophyta]], [[Ginkgophyta]])
