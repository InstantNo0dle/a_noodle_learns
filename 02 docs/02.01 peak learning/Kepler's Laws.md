# Kepler's Laws
Although Kepler proposed the laws, **Newton** was the one who derived/proved them.

There are three:
1. Each planet has an **elliptical** orbit with the sun as one of the foci

2. A line connecting the sun to the planet sweeps out **equal areas** over **equal periods** of time
	- This explains the **periodic variations** in orbital speeds of planets, which travel faster when near the sun (*perihelion*) and slower when further from the sun (*aphelion*)

3. The periods of the planets are proportional to the $\frac{3}{2}$ power of the **major axis lengths** of their orbits
	- Another way to say it: 
		- A planet's **orbital period** *squared* is equal to its **mean solar distance** *cubed* (in [[Astronomical Unit|AU]])
	- Derived from [[Period of Orbit]]
