# Dinoflagellates

These have cellulose plates on the outside with grooves for two flagella. One spins them as they move through the waters.

Half of all species are heterotrophic while the other half are photosynthetic and mixotrophic and make up **phytoplankton**.

Blooms of dinoflagellates during periods of rapid growth lead to **red tide** and releases toxins that kill many organisms in the water. Climate change may exasperate the blooms, posing a threat to human health (toxins can affect us too).
