# C4 Plants
C4 plants fix their carbon **prior** to the begining of the [[Calvin Cycle]], into a *four-carbon* compound.

They have a distinct anatomy from [[C3 Plants]], with **bundled sheath** cells and **mesophyll** cells.
- Bundled sheath cells are arranged around the veins of a leaf
	- The Calvin cycle for C4 plants takes place here
- Mesophyll cells are more loosly arranged and are in close proximity to the bundled sheath cells
	- Carbon is fixated here
- This is a **spatial** separation of steps, unlike [[CAM Plants]]

**Calvin Cycle steps**:
1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">PEP carboxylase</mark> adds $CO_2$ to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">oxaloacetate</mark> , a 4-carbon sugar, in the mesophyll cells
	- PEP carboxylase has a much higher affinity for $CO_2$ and **no** affinity for oxygen, making it much better at carbon fixation in hot climates than RuBisCo
2. Oxaloacetate is converted into <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">malate</mark> , another 4-carbon sugar, which is passed through **plasmodesmata** to bundled sheath cells
3. Malate becomes $CO_2$ and pyruvate in the bundled sheath cells
	1. $CO_2$ continues on through the Calvin cycle to produce <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">G3P</mark> (sugar)
	2. Pyruvate regenerates back into <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">phosphoenolpyruvate</mark> (PEP), consuming <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ATP</mark> in the process
		- In order to generate the ATP needed, bundle sheath cells use [[Cyclic Electron Flow]] 
			- Bundled sheath cells only have [[Photosystem I]]
