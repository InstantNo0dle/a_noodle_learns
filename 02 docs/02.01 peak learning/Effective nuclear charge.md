# Effective nuclear charge

This is the force the nucleus exerts on the electrons after taking into account the existence of other electrons.

It is always less than the actual nuclear charge because of **shielding** by other electrons from the pull of the nucleus.
- Essentially providing addition repulsive interactions that *counteract* the pull of the nucleus
