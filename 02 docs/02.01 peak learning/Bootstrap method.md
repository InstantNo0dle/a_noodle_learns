# Bootstrap method

Bootstrap is a **resampling method** that tries to make a prediction about an estimate for a population parameter $\theta$ on sample data without making too many assumptions.

Obviously, resampling *with replacement* is an important aspect. Otherwise, you're just resampling the original sample and end up the same sample for all.

## Steps
1. Get an original sample from the population with size $n$
2. Resample from the original sample with replacement, size $n$. These resamples are called **bootstrap samples** (B in total)
3. Form an [[Empirical distribution function]] from the resamples
4. Calculate the statistic of the population parameter $\theta$ for each bootstrap sample -> B statistics in total
	- Turn the parameters of interest into a **function** of the distribution function $\theta = g(\hat F)$
	- Plug in the EDF into the function above. EDF is an estimate of the population CDF, so it allows for evaluation of the population parameter.

5. Calculate the variance for the B statistics to approximate the true variance

## Why use bootstrap?
When you sample from the population and generate statistics about that data (mean, median, etc.), those statistics (aka **point estimate**) are virtually never equal to population parameters because of **sampling variability**. It will always have some sort of **standard error**.  

Usually, you'd assume that the population has a certain distribution (say roughly normal) and make inferences using your point estimates and standard error that way.
- In normal distributions, the sampled mean $\mu$ lies within 2 standard errors of population mean $\bar X$ 

However, reality slaps you in the face âœ‹ and two issues arise:
1. You don't know *for sure* the distribution about the population (sometimes you barely know any information at all!)
2. There may not be a formula for the standard error of the statistic you're measuring (like median)

In those scenarios, the bootstrap method is extremely powerful.

## Why does this work?
By the **Law of Large Numbers**, as the number of bootstrapped samples approaches infinity, the mean of the statistic on those B samples converges to the **true mean**.

Similarly, the sample variance does the same thing.
