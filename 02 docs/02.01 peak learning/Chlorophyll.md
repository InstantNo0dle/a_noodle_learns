# Chlorophyll
This is a pigment in green plants and algae that comes in two types:
- [[Chlorophyll a]]
- [[Chlorophyll b]]

The general structure is a **porphyrin ring** with magnesium in its center attached to a **hydrocarbon tail**.
- Porphyrin ring is responsible for the light-absorbing
- Hydrocarbon tail *interacts* with hydrophobic parts of proteins in the thylakoid membrane
