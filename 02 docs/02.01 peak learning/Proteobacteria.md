# Proteobacteria

Fun fact! There is evidence that this was the type of bacteria that went on to become the **mitochondria** when endosymbio-sed.

The bacteria in this group are photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, and heterotrophs.

Chemoautotroph:
- *Thiomargarita namibiensis* is one of the largest prokaryotes
	- It metabolizes hydrogen sulfide and produces sulfur as a waste product.

Heterotrophs:
- *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* - gonorrhea
- *Vibro cholerae* - cholera
- *Helicobacter pylori* - stomach ulcers
