These are expansive, flat regions of **deformed** crystalline rock.
- They contain rocks dating back to Precambrian, being on average 1 billion years old and as much as 4 billion years old

The rocks in these regions demonstrate that forces were imposed on them causing them to fault and fold, leading to the belief that they participated in ancient mountain forming.

The **Canadian Shield** is exposed in Northeastern North America.
