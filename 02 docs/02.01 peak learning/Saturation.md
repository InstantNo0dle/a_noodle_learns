# Saturation

> [!info]+ Definition
> The solvent is full of a solute and addition of more solute leads to precipitation.

Related terms are:
- Supersaturation
	- This is when the solution has more solute than it *should* have (past saturation)
	- Precipitate forms when nucleation site is added, i.e. a stirring rod
- Undersaturation (exactly what you think it is)
