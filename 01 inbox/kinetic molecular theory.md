title: theory
collapse: open
This model is based on *four* assumptions:? #flashcard 
1. Gases are made of molecules in random motion
2. Gas molecules are *infinitesimally* small points (**point masses**)
3. Molecules move in straight paths until they collide
4. Molecules don't influence each other unless they collide
