The table below shows all the formulas and whatâ€™s held constant.

| law                      | formula                   | constants             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [[boyle's law]]          | $P_{2}V_{2}=P_{1}V_{1}$   | temperature           |
| [[charles's law]]        | $T_{1}V_{2}=T_{2}V_{1}$   | pressure              |
| [[Gay-Lussacâ€™s law]]     | $T_{1}P_{2} = T_{2}P_{1}$ | volume                |
| [[Avogadro's principle]] | $n_{2}v_{1} = n_{1}v_{2}$ | temperature, pressure |
| [[law of effusion]] | $\ce{ \frac{{Rate of effusion of A}}{Rate of effusion of B} = \frac{\sqrt{ M_B}}{\sqrt{ M_{A}}} }$                          |  temperature                    |

Of course, thereâ€™s the [[ideal gas law]] that sums all of these equations up ðŸ˜€.

[[law of partial pressures|Dalton's law]] defines partial pressures for all gases.
