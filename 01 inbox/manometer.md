# manometer

This is slightly different from the [[barometer]]. Instead of measuring the atmospheric pressure, it measures the pressure inside a **system**.

There are two possible configurations, open or closed.
- Both involve a U-tube and mercury inside the U-tube to measure the pressure

>[!tldr]+
>For both kinds of setups, the differences in heights of mercury between the two sides of the U-tube is proportional to the pressure of the system.
>- In **open** apparatus, the difference in heights indicates the pressure in the apparatus is lower than *atmospheric pressure* by a proportion
>- In **closed** apparatus, difference is proportional to *system pressure*


## open
One side of the U-tube is open to the atmosphere while the other is closed.

| pressure of system  | levels of mercury |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| system **=** atmosphere | same              |
| system **<** atmosphere | higher on the system side|

## closed
One side of the U-tube is a vacuum and the other side is connected to a closed flask (the system side). The measuring of the pressure of the system using this type of setup *doesn't* require using the **atmospheric pressure**.
