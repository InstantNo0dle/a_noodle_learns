# law of effusion
**Effusion** — the escape of a gas through a small hole or *porous barrier* into a vacuum or other region with very low [[pressure]]. #flashcard 
- This happens because there are more “collisions” of the gas with the hole than in the low pressure side, thus more molecules of gas go from high to low pressure side

>[!important]+ law
>States — The rate of effusion of a gas at constant temperature is *inversely proportional* to the square root of its [[molar mass]]. #flashcard 
>$$\ce{ Rate of effusion \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} }$$

An extension of this law can be made to relate **time** of diffusion to molar mass.
$$\ce{ Time of effusion \propto \sqrt{ M }}$$

Another extension relates the rate of effusion to **temperature** — the rate of effusion increases as temperature increases, directly proportional. #flashcard 
$$\ce{ Rate of effusion \propto \sqrt{ T } }$$
