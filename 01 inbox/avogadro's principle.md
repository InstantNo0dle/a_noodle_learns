# avogadro's principle
>[!important]+ law
>States — under the same **temperature** and **pressure**, a given number of gas particles have the same volume regardless of chemical identity #flashcard 
- In problems where the [[pressure]] and temperature is held constant, you can use **volume** instead of having to convert to moles!

The principle employs a unit called **molar volume**:
$$\begin{align}
V_{m}=\frac{V}{n} \\ \\
n_{2}v_{1} = n_{1}v_{2}
\end{align}$$


At **STP** (standard temperature and pressure), that is $\ce{ 1 atm , 0 \degree C =298K}$, the molar volume is $22.4 \frac{L}{mol}$.
- Don’t confuse this with **STAP** (standard ambient temperature and pressure), which is $\ce{ 1 bar}, 25°C = 298 K$ and has a molar volume of $24.79 L  \cdot mol^{-1}$
