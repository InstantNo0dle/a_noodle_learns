# charles's law
This and [[Gay-Lussac’s law]] relate **temperature** to volume and [[pressure]].

Turns out that they discovered this and the other law when trying to optimize balloon performance in the hot air balloon hobby! 

From *extrapolating* the graphs from experimental values of different gases to the smallest possible volume (0), absolute zero ($0K$) was found to be $\ce{ -273.15 ° C}$.
