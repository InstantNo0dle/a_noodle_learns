# boyle's law
Robert Boyle used J-tubes to come up with this law. 
1. He added mercury into the tube, trapping end in the shorter side.
2. He noticed that the more mercury he added (which exerts more pressure), the less volume there was of the air trapped -- it was *compressed*.

>For a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature, the **volume** of the gas is *inversely proportional* to **pressure**.
