# Gay-Lussac’s law
This relates [[pressure]] and temperature of a gas.

>[!important]+ law
>States — As the temperature decreases to absolute zero, pressure also approaches zero, so temperature varies *proportionally* with pressure. #flashcard  <!--SR:!2022-11-22,3,250-->
>$$\ce{ P \propto absolute temperature }$$
- Determined through extrapolation (similarly to finding absolute zero in [[charles's law]]): 0 pressure at $273.15°K$.
