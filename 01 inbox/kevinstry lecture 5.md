#  lecture 5: equilibrium
## Phyisical equilibria
This is concerned with phase changes.
- **Heat of fusion** is the transition between solid and liquid
- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-17 at 9.30.56 PM.png]]
- Supercooling: Liquid remains liquid below freezing point
	- NOT an equilibrium state!
- **Critical point**: liquids and gases are no longer different
	- Yields supercritical fluid that is in-between liquids and gases
- Heating profiles and cooling profiles

		- Basically a temperature vs. heat supplied graph
			- At a phase change, the temperature doesn't change
- Transitions to and from *gases* are the most important
	- Vapor pressure: pressure exerted by vapor when it is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid/condensed phase
		- Dynamic equilbrium is the transition at the interface between gas and liquid
	- More volatile gases = higher vapor pressure  and weaker IMF
- Clausius Clapeyron (formula)
	- $$
	\ln \frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}= \Delta 
$$

Solutions
- Molar solubility: molar concentration of a substance in a saturated solution
	- how much of a salt dissolved
- Miscible: two liquids forming a homogenous mixture when mixed together
- Usually solubility for solids increase with temperature
- Thermodynamics of formation
	- $\Delta H_{sol}$ components
		1. Break solute-solute interactions
		2. Break solvent-solvent interactions
		3. Break hydrogen bonds
- Gaseous solubility changing with pressure and temp
	- Henry's law
		- $s=k_{h}P$
	- Gaseous solubility decreases with increasing temp

Volatile solute: a solute that contributes to the vapor pressure above the solution.

Colligative properties
- Relevant for non-volatile solutes
- These properties only depend on the number of particles (substance identity doesnt matter)
	- Decreasing vapor pressure (with added solute)
		- **Raoult's law**: $P_{solution} = \sum x_{substituent}P_{substituent}$ where $P_{substituent}$ is the vapor pressure of the pure volatile solute
	- Boiling point elevation
		- Solutions with non-volatile solutes 
		- i: [[Van't Hoff factor]]
		- k_b: ebullioscopic constant
		- b: molality
	- Freezing point depression
		- 

Chemical equilibria is concerned with chemical changes.
- Molecules themselves are changing
