# law of partial pressures
At *low* pressures, all gases respond the same way to changes in [[pressure]], temperature, and volume, so the composition doesn’t matter.
- A *mixture* of gases that don’t react with each other acts like a *pure* gas

>[!important]+ law
>States — Given the partial pressures of the gases in a mixture, the total pressure of the mixture is the **sum**. #flashcard 
>$$P=P_{A}+P_{B} + P_{C}\dots$$
- The fact that this equation holds true indicates that the gases don’t have any interaction whatsoever

One common problem that this law can be used on is for finding the total pressure of a “**humid gas**”, or the question saying “*collected over water*”. 
$$\ce{ P = P_{dry\ air} + P_{water\ vapor}}$$

The law can also be related to **mole fractions** (the fraction of the whole mixture one particular gas accounts for, in moles) $x_{A}=\frac{n_{A}}{n} \implies nx_{A}=n_{A}$
$$P_{A}=\frac{n_{A}RT}{V} \implies P_{A} = \frac{nx_{A}RT}{V} \implies P_{A}= x_{A}P$$
- This is the formal definition for the **partial pressure** of a gas, both real and ideal.
