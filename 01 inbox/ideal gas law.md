# ideal gas law
>[!important]+ law
This combines all of the properties of gases described by the [[gas laws]] into one equation:
Equation — $$PV=nRT$$ #flashcard 

$R$ is a **universal gas constant**, the same for every gas and has multiple forms with different units.
- R in *joules*/mole — $8.314 J \cdot mol^{-1}$ #flashcard 
- R in *atm* — $0.8205 L \cdot atm \cdot K^{-1} \cdot mol^{-1}$ #flashcard 

Another variation that can be easily derived is the **combined gas law**.
$$\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}$$

When applying this equation to a question: 
1. Try to take note of what variables/values are kept constant/shared
2. Set everything equal to that those constants
3. Substitute to get the desired result!
