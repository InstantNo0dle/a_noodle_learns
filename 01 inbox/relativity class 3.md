## velocity addition
- 3 observers (reference frames) $O_1, O_2, O_3$ in **relative motion** with respect to each other
	- All inertial frames
	- $O_1$ has velocity $v_{12}$ with respect to $O_2$ and same for the rest
	- Clocks are synchronized
		- But [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] make it so that there are differences
	- Unprimed coordinates to $O_1$, primed to $O_2$ and double primed to $O_3$
- Problem: Given *two* **relative velocities**, what is the third ($v_{13}$)?
	- Conceptual: Observer on the ground, there's a river and a swimmer
		- River has velocity towards some direction
			- Swimmer is moving with respect to the water, with a velocity that is also with respect to the **water**
			- To the observer on the ground, the swimmer is moving "faster"
				- Add velocities
			- This is velocity addition in gallilean relativity (derived from [[gallilean boosts]])
	- Goal is to find formula for velocity addition in [[postulates of special relativity|special relativity]]
		- Use same conceptual thought simulation and [[lorentz boosts#^d2bf67|lorentz boosts]] instead of gallilean boosts
			- Two events that both label the swimmer (all equations address the **swimmer** because they are demonstrating velocity addition)
				- A: swimmer exists at some time $t_A$
				- B: swimmer exists at some time $t_A>t_B$ 
			- Can apply same formulas to go from primed to nonprimed (inverse of lorentz boosts) by making velocities negative (do the same to go from double primed to nonprimed)

			- Velocity is $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, so use the equations to solve
				- The swimmer isn't moving with respect to themself, so $\Delta x'' = 0$
			- Equation is:
				- $$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_{1,2}+v_{2,3}}{1+\frac{v_{1,2}v_{2,3}}{c^2}}=v_{1,3}$$
				- $\frac{v_{1,2}v_{2,3}}{c^2}$ is very small in everyday situations (because velocities are much smaller than $c$ usually), so we actually see gallilean velocity addition!
					- Maxima is $c$ when equation is graphed → nothing can travel faster than the speed of light
				- Can confirm that speed of light is constant in all reference frames by letting $v_{1,3} = c$. It will be found that $v_{1,2}=v_{2,3}=c$
## spacetime diagrams
- Focus on 1+1 dimensions (space and time)
	- To make dimensions consistent, multiply time by $c$ → $ct$
- Event is a point in the diagram
- **Wordline**: *curve* in spacetime
	- Parameterized set of events
	- Describes an object’s motion in spacetime
	- **Light rays** always have a worldline with a slope of 1 or -1 ($\frac{\Delta x}{c \Delta t}$)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-19 at 11.04.35 AM.png|450]]
		- Worldline would be preserved under [[lorentz boosts]]
		- In reality, you can’t have a worldline with a slope *less* than 1 because that would mean the object travels faster than light
- Primed coordinate system on the unprimed system as axes (in the background)
	- [[lorentz boosts]] are *very* relevant
	- Draw the $t'$\ axis: it is a set characterized by $x’=0$
		- $$x'=0 \implies \gamma(x-vt)=0 \implies x=vt \implies \frac{v}{c}(ct)$$
	- $x’$ axis is characterized by $t’=0$
		- $$t'=0 \implies \gamma\left( t-\frac{vx}{c^2} \right) = 0 \implies t= \frac{vx}{c^2} \implies ct=\frac{v}{c}x$$
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-19 at 11.28.20 AM.png|400]]
		- Effect of a boost: the coordinate axes get tilted towards each other
	- Visualizing [[relative simultaneity]]:
		- **Line of simultaneity** is just a line parallel to the $x$ axis passing through that time step
		- While two events may be on the same line of simultaneity according to one observer, because the axes are tilted to another observer (one on the train, so because of boosts), they are no longer on the same line and are not simultaneous to that

	- Visualizing [[length contraction]]: UNFINISHED
		- Plot the light ray worldline as defined above
		- When $t’, x’$ are both 0, the axes are lined up
			- Event A: light ray is emitted from the back of the train $(t', x')=(0,0)$
			- Event B: light ray returns back to source, $(t',x')=(\Delta t',0)$
			- Then just plot the coordinates on the respective axes
## spacetime interval
- **Euclidean norm** finds the distance between two points using their coordinates (well-known distance formula)
	- $$\mid  A - B\mid = \sqrt{ (x_{1}-y_{1})^2+(x_{2}-y_{2}) }$$
- Geometry of spacetime is **Minkowskian** — distances are measured differently
	- Given events A and B:
		- $$\Delta s ^{2} = -c^{2}(t_{1}-t_{2})^{2} + (x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2} + (z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}$$
		- There exists negative distances
		- Basically just euclidian norm but have time part multiplied by $-c^2$
		- and yes, $\Delta s^2$ is the spacetime interval
	- Distances are *invariant* under lorentz transformations!
