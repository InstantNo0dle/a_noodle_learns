The "tower" of mercury "falls" until it exerts a pressure that matches that of the atmosphere. 
- To interpret a barometer, use the formula that compares the *height* of mercury to atmospheric pressure.
	- Derived from the standard [[pressure]] formula

\begin{align}
P = \frac{F}{A}=\frac{mgh}{A} = \frac{dhA \cdot g}{A} \\
\therefore P = dhg
