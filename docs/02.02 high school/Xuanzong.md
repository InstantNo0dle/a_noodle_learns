# Xuanzong

He was an emperor during the [[Tang dynasty]] who reigned from 713-756. He came to power by leading a palace revolt that destroyed Empress Wei and her supporters.

In the beginning, he pushed for political and economic reforms by appointing capable officials to high positions. However, he soon got bored ðŸ¥± (because who wouldn't be bored running an empire...right?) and started to turn to the arts and enjoyed the pleasures of his wealth.

He patronized musicians (he himself played music) and had thousands of concubines that waited for his attention. In particular, he fell head-over-heels for **Yang Guifei**.

His romance with Yang Guifei is one of the most famous in Chinese history.
- This was after his second wife died, leaving him lonely
- Yang Guifei was a member of the harem of one of the princes
- She became a royal concubine and was powerful
	- Used this power to promote her relatives to higher positions in the government. But other members of the court despised her greedy nature -> popular unrest.

Since he had neglected state affairs for so long, the economy and military power was declining, which made dealing with revolts difficult. 
One in particular was by **An Lushan**, a military leader of nomadic origin, who wanted to found a new dynasty. The revolt was crushed but his army forced him to execute Yang Guifei leading him to no longer be fit to rule.
