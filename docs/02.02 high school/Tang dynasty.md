# Tang dynasty
### Rise
The rise of **Li Yuan**, the Duke of Tang, prevented complete dissolution of imperial order after the death of [[Yangdi]], ending the [[Sui dynasty]]. ^cf772b

He was a very loyal official to Yangdi, but as the emperor became more and more insane, his sons and allies convinced him that rebellions were needed to save the empire.

He ruled for 3 years before abdicating to his son Tang Taizong (623-626 CE) and laid the foundations for the golden age of the Tang dynasty. 
- Tang Taizong renamed his father “**Emperor Gaozu**”

### Fall
Imperial rule began to weaken ~ a century before open persecution of Buddhists began:
- Empress Wei tried to control the throne by poisoning her husband, the son of Empress Wu and put her own son on the throne
- [[Xuanzong]] started a palace revolt that overthrew Empress Wei, starting a high point in the Tang dynasty
- After Xuanzong, the quality of rulers substantially decreased

The Tang had formed alliances with nomads living on the Northern borders of the empire in order to tamp down revolts. They also gave power to nomadic commanders, which backfired when they used political instability to control large areas of northern China.

Regional governors basically became independent rulers with the Tang central power having become pretty much obsolete.

The last emperor was forced to resign in 907, leading to the formation of the [[Song dynasty]].

## Military Achievements
The Tang conquered as far as Afghanistan, forcing nomadic peoples to submit. They repaired the northern walls and created frontier armies recruited from mostly Turkic people.
- Sons of Turkic leaders were sent to the capital as hostages (to guarantee obedience) and were attempted to be assimilated into Chinese culture

They tried to push South and conquer Vietnam, but couldn’t — Truong sisters are notable for leading an army to fight back.
- Did learn about Champa rice, which could grow much faster than normal rice, allowing for population growth

Under Taizong, the Tang were even able to establish a vassal kingdom in Korea called **Silla**.
- Koreans paid tribute every year to be left alone

## Political System
Major efforts were put into rebuilding and expanding the bureaucracy that started in the [[Sui dynasty]]. 
- From the Tang onwards, political power was split between imperial families and bureaucrats; aristocratic families lost a lot of power

Meritocracy through an examination system was highly valued, connecting tested merit with authority and status.
- **Ministry of Rites** administered different kinds of exams
- The highest offices were populated with **jinshi**, a title given to those who could pass exams on the philosophical or legal classics of the highest level
	- They were treated formally and with high respect, even amongst close acquaintances
- Passing exams of all levels meant special social status and exemption for corporal punishment

However, connections still mattered a great deal. Powerful households (often part of the old aristocracy) dominated imperial academies and pulled strings to ensure positions.

## Culture
Revival of the emphasis on Confucian learning strained relationships with Buddhist monastic orders. There were two main sects that were popular after the fall of the Han.
- **Pure land** sect of Mahayana Buddhism was popular amongst the peasants because it provided hope and refuge during periods of war
- **Chan** variant, aka **Zen** emphasized meditation and appreciating natural beauty, gaining popularity amongst the elite and educated

**Empress Wu** (690-705) supported Buddhism the most, trying to elevate it to a state religion.
- Commissioned Buddhist paintings and colossal sculptures
- Had massive pagodas built

Of course, jealousy from Daoism and Confucianism led to the downfall of Buddhism. ^7114e5
- Confucian scholar-adminstrators convinced the rulers that monasteries were draining money from the empire: Monasteries weren't taxed and neither were the peasants that worked there.
- **Emperor Wuzong** openly prosecuted Buddhism
- After that, Buddhism was never as powerful as it was. Confucianism took over as the central ideology.
