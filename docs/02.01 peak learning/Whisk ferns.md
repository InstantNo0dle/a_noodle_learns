# Whisk ferns

These are known as "*living fossils*" because they are the only vascular plant *lacking true roots* and resembled ancient fossils. 
- *Psilotum*
- *Tmesipteris*

They have very branched stems that have outgrowths reminiscent of **reduced [[Leaves]]**. Each "knob" has three fused sporangia.

Instead of roots, they have modified absorptive **rhizoids** to help still take up water and nutrients.

They are, of course, [[Sporophyll#^4b0ab8|homosporous]].
