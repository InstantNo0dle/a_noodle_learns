# Work
Work can be found for a **rotational situation** by considering the following:
- [[Torque]] does work on a rigid body when it accelerates it in a fixed axis, so [[Rotational Kinetic Energy]] can change
	- If that is the only energy of the body that changes, then the **work-kinetic energy theorem** can be applied
$$
\Delta K = K_f-K_i = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2_f - \frac{1}{2}I\omega_i^2
$$
It can also be found using the integrated linear counterpart:
$$
W = \int^{\theta_f}_{\theta_i}\tau d\theta
$$
- If torque is constant, then:
	- $W = (\theta_f - \theta_i)\tau$
