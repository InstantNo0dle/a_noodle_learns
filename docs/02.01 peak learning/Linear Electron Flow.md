This process is key to **energy transformation** of light.

**Steps**:
1. Photons hit the accessory pigments in the light-harvesting complexes of [[Photosystem II]] and the energy is fed to [[Chlorophyll a]] where one electron is excited to a higher energy state
2. The electron is transferred to the primary electron acceptor and P680 becomes $P680^+$ as it has lost an electron
3. Water is split by an enzyme and the two electrons are supplied to the pair of $P680^+$. $H^+$ is released into the **thylakoid space**
	- Oxygen from the split water join to form $O_2$
4. [[Electron Transport Chain#First Electron Transport Chain|First electron transport chain]]
5. Steps 1 and 2 except with P700
6. Photoexcited electrons from the ETC can be accepted by $P700^+$
7. [[Electron Transport Chain#Second Electron Transport Chain|Second electron transport chain]]
5. $NADP^+$ reductase transfers electrons from Fd to $NADP^+$
	- Electrons will be more readily available for use in the Calvin cycle because NADPH is at a higher energy level than water
	- Removes $H^+$ from the stroma
