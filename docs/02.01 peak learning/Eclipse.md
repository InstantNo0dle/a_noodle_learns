# Eclipse
A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">solar eclipse</mark> occurs when the Moon is directly in between the Earth and the Sun, only during the **new-Moon** phase.
- The Moon casts a shadow on the Earth, tracing a stripe where the solar eclipse can be seen
- It slowly blocks the Sun from view, but this only lasts around *7 minutes* because its shadow is so small
- The Sun is almost completely blocked out except for its white outer atmosphere (**corona**)

A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">lunar eclipse</mark> occurs when the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, only during the **full-Moon** phase.
- Earth's shadow slowly moves over the Moon, and this can last for up to *four* hours
- The Moon is still visible in a copper color because the Earth's atmosphere reflects red light, which reflects off the Moon

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Umbra</mark>: the dark part of the shadow
- People here can see the total eclipse

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Penumbra</mark>: the light part of the shadow
- People here can only see a partial eclipse

The Moon's plane of orbit is inclined $5\degree$ from the [[Earth's Revolution#^99c521|ecliptic]], limiting the number of times these phenomena can happen throughout the year.
- Normally, the conditions are met only twice a year, so there are usually four eclipses in one year (six months apart)
- Sometimes, there may be three eclipses in a month
- Very rarely, if the first set of eclipses occur at the very begining of the year, there can be up to three sets of eclipses (beginning, middle, end of year)
	- Maximum **7** eclipses total, if one set has 3 eclipses in a month
