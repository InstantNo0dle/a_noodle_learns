# Plants

Plants are recognized to have arose from within a group of [[Charophytes]] to form the Plantae clade. 

Within the phylogenetic tree's branch for algae, there are 3 possible "plant" kingdoms (which are really clades):
- **Viridiplantae**, including [[Chlorophytes]]
- **Streptophyta**, including [[Charophytes]]
- **Plantae**, known as embryophytes

Plants have derived traits not see in [[Charophytes]]:
- [[Alternation of generations]]
- Walled spores produced in sporangia
	- But have sporopollenin, like the zygotes of [[Charophytes#^9c118f|Charophytes]]
- Multicellular zygotes remain dependent on the female gametophyte -- like an embryo. There are specialized **placental transfer cells** that mediate uptake of nutrients from the "mother" plant ingrowths of the membrane and wall.
- Apical meristems

Some plants have even more derived traits:
- Cuticle
- Stomata
- Forming mycorrhizae with fungi

Plants are usually organized by **vasculature** and presence of seeds:
- [[Nonvascular plants]]
- Vascular plants
	- [[Seedless vascular plants]]
	- [[Seed vascular plants]]
