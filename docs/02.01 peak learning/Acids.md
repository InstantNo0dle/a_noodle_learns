# Acids
Acidity was first associated with **sourness** of citrus fruits.
- "Acid" comes from *acidus* in Latin, meaning sour

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Arrhenius</mark> defined it as such:
>[!note] Definition
>An **acid** is a substance that produces $H^+$ ions when dissolved in water.
- This came from observing that when acids (like hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, etc) were dissolved in water, they behaved as if they were [[Strong Electrolytes]]

The *ionization* of acids can be represented like this:
$$
HA (aq) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow H_3O^+(aq) + A^-(aq)
$$

Formulas for acids are usually written with the "*acidic*" hydrogen atom(s) listed first and any "*nonacidic*" hydrogen atoms incorporated into the rest of the chemical formula.
- "*Acidic*" hydrogen atoms are those that produce $H^+$ ions in solution
- Ex. Acetic acid: $HC_2H_3O_2$
