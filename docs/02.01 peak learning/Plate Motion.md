**Unequal distribution of heat** is the driving force behind plate tectonics.

The interior of the Earth is very hot, while the exterior is relatively cold, leading to a convection mechanism:
- Hot, less dense material **rise**, while cooler, denser material **sinks**
	- [[Mantle]] is weak and very close to its melting point
		- It slowly rises while cooler **oceanic lithosphere** sink into the mantle leading to movements of the lithosphere.
