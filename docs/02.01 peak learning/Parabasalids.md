# Parabasalids

These protists' reduced mitochondria (like [[Diplomonads]]) are called **hydrogenosomes** because they generate energy anaerobically and release hydrogen gas as a byproduct.

A notable parabasalid is *Trichomonas vaginalis*, which is an STD that travels through reproductive and urinary tracts via flagella.
