# Volumetric analysis

>[!info]+ Definition
>This is a method of finding the **concentration** of a solution by measuring volume.

A well known and ubiquitous example is [[Titration]]. You can use the volume of the two solutions to calculate the [[Molarity]] and then the [[Moles]] of solute in each. Then, just use the [[Reaction stoichiometry#^09fc10|mole ratio]]!
1. Calculate the # of moles of titrant based on volume and molarity
2. Use balanced chemical equation to convert # of moles of titrant to # moles of analyte
3. Find the molarity or mass of the analyte using the # of moles and the volume measured
