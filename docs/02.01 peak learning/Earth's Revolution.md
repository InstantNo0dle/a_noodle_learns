The Earth is on average 150 million kilometers away from the Sun.
- During **perihelion**, it is 147 million kilometers away on January 3rd
- During **aphelion**, it is 152 million kilometers away on July 4th

The Earth's elliptical orbit is the reason why the Sun appears to be shifted by **one degree** a day when comparing with the celestial sphere.
- [[Earth's Rotation#^6820d4|Explanation for difference between sidereal and mean solar day]]
- One degree: 2x its apparent width (0.5 degrees)

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Ecliptic</mark>: annual path of the Sun relative to the celestial sphere ^99c521
- The plane that connects all the points lying on this path is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the plane of the ecliptic</mark>
- The Earth, Moon and other planets lie on nearly the same plane, also near the ecliptic
	- However, the Earth's axis is tilted *23.5* degrees from the plane, leading to seasons
