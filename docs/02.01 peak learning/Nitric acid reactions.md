# Nitric acid reactions

This is a special class of [[Single displacement reactions]], that usually goes "a piece of silver/copper is added to nitric acid". 

Instead of proceeding with single displacement (impossible because of activity series), two gases may form.
- Concentrated nitric acid
	- Forms $\ce{NO2}$
- Dilute nitric acid
	- Forms $\ce{NO}$
