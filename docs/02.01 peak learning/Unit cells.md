# Unit cells

> [!info]+ Definition
> A unit cell is the simplest repeating unit in a crystal, like a building block for the crystal.

Maybe they can be thought of as "monomers" of a crystal.

They are defined by **lattice points**, which are points about where the particles can *vibrate* in the crystal.

Criteria for being a unit cell:
1. Simplest repeating unit
2. Opposite faces are parallel
3. Edge of unit cell connects equivalent points

**Auguste Bravis** found 14 types of unit cells that aligned with the three criteria.

## Problem solving
When given a unit cell, ask yourself "where is the atom?" and "How many cubes can you put around that vertex?"
- Atom on a vertex
	- Shared with 8 unit cells, each vertex atom = 1/8 of an atom
- Atom on the face
	- Shared with 2 unit cells, each face atom = 1/2 of an atom
- Atom on an edge
	- Shared with 4 unit cells, each edge atom = 1/4 of an atom
- Body atom (in the center)
	- Shared with 1 unit cell, each body atom = 1 atom
