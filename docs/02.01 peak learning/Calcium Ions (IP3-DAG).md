# Calcium Ions (IP3-DAG)
Calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) are able to act as second messengers because the concentration inside the cell (cytoplasm) is *much lower* than outside.
- Even more widely used than [[cAMP]]
- Much is stored in the **endoplasmic reticulum**, which actively imports calcium
- Only a small **quantity** increase in the number of calcium ions is enough to elicit a large **percentage** change

**Steps** for transduction:
1. Signaling molecule binds to the receptor, activating <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">phospholipase C</mark> 
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Phospholipase C</mark> cleaves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$PIP_2$</mark> , a membrane phospholipid into <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">$DAG$</mark> and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">$IP_3$</mark> 
3. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">$IP_3$</mark> diffuses through the cell and binds to an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">$IP_3$-gated calcium channel</mark> in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
4. Calcium ions rush out and raise the concentration
5. Proteins are activated downstream in the signaling cascade
