# CAM Plants
CAM plants close their stomata during the day and open them at night, also fixing $CO_2$ **prior** to feeding it into the [[Calvin Cycle]].
- This allows them to prevent **water loss** and intake of $CO_2$ during the day
- **Temporal** separation of steps, unlike in [[C4 Plants]]

During the night, $CO_2$ is fixated into various **organic acids** and stored in **mesophyll cells**.
- Once daytime comes, $CO_2$ is *released* from those organic acids to be incorporated into sugars

Examples:
- Succulents
- Cacti
- Pineappples
