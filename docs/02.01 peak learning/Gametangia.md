# Gametangia

These are reproductive structures formed by gametophytes. 

Female gametangia are **archegonia** while male gametangia are **antheridia**.

Usually sperm will move towards the egg, attracted by chemicals from the archegonia. The egg remains in the archegonium and after fertilization becomes an embryo that develops into a sporophyte.
