# Asthenosphere
This is the layer beneath the [[Lithosphere]] within the [[Upper Mantle]] that is around **100** kilometers thick (250 to 350 kilometers).
- Much softer because of partial melting in the uppermost portion
	- Rocks are very close to their melting temperature and are easily deformed, leading to some fluidity.
