**Complex I** recieves *two* electrons from each [[NADH]] molecule.

1. **FMN** (flavin mononucleotide) directly recieves those electrons
2. Passed to **Fe-S** (iron sulfur protein), which has both iron and sulfur bound.
3. **Ubiquinone**, a hydrophobic electron carrier, isn't attached to any one complex
	- aka Coenzyme Q (CoQ)

**Complex II** recieves *two* electrons from each [[FADH2]] molecule.

1. **Fe-S** recieves
2. **Ubiquinone** gets electrons

**Cytochromes** have a *heme group* as their *prosthetic group* which contains an iron atom reponsible for gaining and losing electrons.

**Complex III** interacts with "uphill" neighbors I and II through **ubiquinone**.

- Cytochrome b
- Fe-S
- Cytochrome c1
- **Cytochrome c** acts as anther *electron carrier* between complexes.

**Complex IV** recieves from cytochrome C, essentially complex III.

- Cytochrome a
- **Cytochrome a3**, the last electron acceptor, is very electronegative, allowing it to pass electrons to oxygen

As oxygen is being reduced, it also takes up 2 protons in adittion to the electrons donated by the ETC.

## Chloroplast
### First Electron Transport Chain
Photoexcited electrons are passed from the **primary electron acceptor** of [[Photosystem II]] to P700 of [[Photosystem I]].

The components are:
- **Plastoquinone**
- **Cytochrome complex**: This generates a proton gradient for production of ATP through [[Chemiosmosis#Photosynthesis|chemiosmosis]]
- **Plastocyanin**: Delivers electrons to P700 light-harvesting complex pigments

### Second Electron Transport Chain
Photoexcited electrons are passed from the **primary electron acceptor** of P700 down another ETC.

The main component is **ferredoxin** (Fd), which is the electron carrier.

Since there is no cytochrome complex to produce a proton gradient, no ATP is produced.
