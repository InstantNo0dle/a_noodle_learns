# Strong Electrolytes
These are substances that are **completely ionized** when dissolved in water.

There are three classses of strong electrolytes:
- **Soluble salts**: These salts separate into their component ions and are hydrated,  leaving no salt units present
	- Ex. $NaCl \rightarrow Na^+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq)$
- **Strong [[Acids]]**: These completely dissociate into their ions ($H^+$ and variable anion), like souble salts
	- Ex. $HCl, NO_3, H_2SO_4$ 
- **Strong [[Bases]]**: These are like strong acids, but completely dissociate into $OH^-$ and variable cation
	- Ex. $NaOH, KOH$
