These [[Seedless vascular plants]] are more closely related to [[Seed vascular plants]] than [[Lycophyta|lycophytes]] are. They share multiple similar characteristics, including:
- Presence of **megaphyll** [[Leaves]]
- Roots that can branch throughout the length of the root (not just at the growing tip)

There are three groups:
- [[Ferns]]
- [[Horsetails]]
- [[Whisk ferns]]
