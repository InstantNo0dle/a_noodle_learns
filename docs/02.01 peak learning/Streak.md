# Streak
This is the color of the **powdered mineral**, and is much more diagnostic than color since it doesn't vary as much.

It can be produced by rubbing the mineral against a **streak plate** -- unglazed porcelain.

From this, it is possible to tell the [[Luster]] of the mineral:
- If the streak is *dark*, the mineral has a metallic luster
- A *light* streak means the mineral has a nonmetallic luster
