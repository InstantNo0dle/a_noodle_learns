# Stoichiometry

> [!info]+ Definition
> Stoichiometry is defined as the relationship between the quantities of **reactants** and **products** throughout the course of the reaction.

## Main concepts
- Mass balance or conservation of matter
	- "You get what you put in"
- Charge balance
	- Systems tend to be neutral
- [[Measures of concentration]]
- [[Empirical formula]]
	- [[Combustion analysis]]
- [[Reaction stoichiometry]]
	- [[Limiting reactant]]

> Dimensional analysis is *very* useful for preventing careless mistakes

## General problem solving strategy
1. Write/balance reaction to describe the problem
2. Think about what values are given
	- Circle important information
3. What values do you want?
4. How to get from step 2 to step 3?
	- Look to convert between mass, number of atoms, and [[Moles]] (any two of them)

For **neutralization**/**titration** reactions, the following formula is very powerful.
$$N_1V_1 = N_2V_2$$
- $N$ = [[Normality]]
- $V$ = volume
- Streamlines conversion from concentration to [[Moles]]
	- Can also be used for **dilution** equations

Mixture questions essentially boil down to a system of equations.

## Example problems
Easy problems only involve a few simple conversions; there is no reaction.

 > [!example]+ A solution of magnesium chloride that is $\ce{5.10 \%}$ magnesium by mass has a density $\ce{1.17 g/mL}$ . How many [[Moles]] of $\ce{Cl^-}$ ions are in $\ce{300 mL}$ of the solution?

For harder problems, you need to write reactions! Often mixture problems or determining molecular/empirical formulas.

> [!example]+ A folk medicine used in the Anhui province of China to treat acute dysentery is cha-tiao-qi, a preparation of the leaves of *Acer ginnala*. Reaction of one of the active ingredients in cha-tiao-qi with water yields gallic acid, a powerful antidysenteric agent. Gallic acid is known to contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. A chemist wanting to determine the molecular formula of gallic acid burned $\ce{1.000 g}$ of the compound in an elemental analyzer. The products of the combustion were $\ce{1.811 g}$ of $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{0.3172 g}$ of $\ce{H2O}$. (a) Determine the empirical formula of the compound. (b) The molar mass was found to be $\ce{170.12 g * mol^{-1}}$. What is the molecular formula of gallic acid?

>[!example]+ A mixture consisting of only sodium chloride $\ce{NaCl}$ and potassium chloride $\ce{KCl}$ weighs $\ce{1.0000 g}$. When the mixture is dissolved in water and an excess of silver nitrate is added, all the chloride ions associated with the original mixture are precipitated as insoluble silver chloride ($\ce{AgCl}$). The mass of the silver chloride is found to be $\ce{2.1476 g}$. Calculate the mass percentages of sodium chloride and potassium chloride in the original mixture.
