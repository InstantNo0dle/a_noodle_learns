# Radial distribution function

This is another measure of probability density similar to the **square of the wavefunction** except it is the total for all directions and all kinds of orbitals.
- Similar! But ***not*** the same

>[!tldr] Put simply, it is the total probability of finding an electron in a given region.

It depends on the distance from the nucleus $r$ and the thickness of the shell $\delta r$: $P(r)\delta R$ 
$$
P(r) = r^2R^2(r)
$$

Finding the radial distribution function for an s-orbital uses the square of the wavefunction:
$$P(r) = 4\pi r^2\psi^2(r)$$
- $P$ is largest (probability) at the **Bohr radius**, so it is the radius where an electron is most likely to be found
