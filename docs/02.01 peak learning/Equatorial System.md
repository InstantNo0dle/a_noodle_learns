# Equatorial System
The equatorial system divides the celestial sphere into a grid of **coordinates** similar to the longitude-latitude system on Earth.

Landmarks:
- The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">celestial North and South Poles</mark> are aligned with the terrestrial ones.
	- Because it seems like the celestial sphere rotates around the axis connecting these poles
- The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">celestial equator</mark> is the intersection of the Earth's equatorial plane with the celestial sphere

Coordinate system:
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Declination</mark>: Angular distance north or south of the celestial equator
	- Usually expressed in degrees
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Right ascension</mark>: Angular distance eastward on the celestial equator from the point of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">vernal equinox</mark>
	- The vernal equinox position is the point in the sky where the **Sun** crosses the **celestial equator** on the first day of Spring
	- Usually expressed in hours
