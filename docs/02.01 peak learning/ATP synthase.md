# ATP synthase
This protein is responsible for using the proton-motive force generated by the [[Electron Transport Chain]] to synthesize ATP.

It consists of four main parts:
1. **Stator**: Protons flow through a channel as like an "entrance" to the protein
2. **Rotor**: Protons bind to binding sites and changes the shape of the subunit so that it spins
	- After the protons have spun once fully, they exit through another channel of the stator
3. **Rod**: Spinning of the rotor causes the rod, located internally to spin
4. **Knob**: Attached to the rod and is stationary, controlled by the stator
	- Spinning of the rod causes activation of catalytic sites, and thus production of ATP from ADP and $P_i$.

Biochemists have agreed that it takes roughly **4** $H^+$ to pass through ATP synthase to synthesize 1 ATP.
