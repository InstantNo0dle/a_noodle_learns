# Anthocerophyta

These are medium height, growing up to ~5 cm high.

They have funny sporophytes, having only a sporangium but no [[Nonvascular plants#^63c36d|foot]] or [[Nonvascular plants#^186371|seta]].

Notably, they are one of the first few species to colonize new habitats with moist soils because of their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing [[Cyanobacteria]] (since in moist areas, nitrogen is lacking).
