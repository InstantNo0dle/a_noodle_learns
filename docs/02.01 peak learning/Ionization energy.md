# Ionization energy

>[!info]+ Definition
>This is the amount of energy needed to remove electrons from an atom in the gas phase.
- Normally expressed in the unit **electronvolts** ($eV$) or **kilojoules per mole of atoms** ($kj \cdot mol^{-1}$)

Atoms with *low* ionization energies readily become cations and can conduct electricity.
- Property of metals, found in the lower left

Successive ionization energies are always *greater* than the prior ones, especially if taking from an inner shell/noble gas core.

Trends in the periodic table:
- *Decreases* going down **groups**
	- Further away from nucleus means easier to remove
- *Increases* going across **periods**
	- Increase in [[Effective nuclear charge]] as you go across
