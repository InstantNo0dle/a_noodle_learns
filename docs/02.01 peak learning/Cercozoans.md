These are ameboid and flagellated that feed using **threadlike pseudopodia**.

Most are heterotrophs, living as parasites or predators. They are fierce little guys!

Some defy the social norm and are mixotrophs, belonging to **chloroarachniophytes**. None though, are as brave as *Paulinella*, an autotroph that uses a **chromatophore** to perform photosynthesis (there may actually be more).

*Paulinella chromatophora* provides another instance of primary endosymbiosis. Chromatophore's membranes have a peptidoglycan layer, which indicates that they came from bacteria (likely [[Cyanobacteria]]). However, they are different from plastids, found through DNA analysis.
