# G-Protein Coupled Receptors
G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR) make up an eukaryotic protein family that interact with **G proteins** (bind GTP). ^4f679b

Secondary structure:
- 7 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices
- Specific loops that form binding sites for the signaling molecules.

**Steps** for reception:
1. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">G protein</mark> is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and acts like an "on/off" switch.
	- When it has **GDP** bound, it's "off"; when it has **GTP** bound, it's "on"

2. The signaling molecule binds <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">GPCR</mark> 
	1. It changes shape and binds the inactive <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">G protein</mark> 
	2. Binding causes the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">G protein</mark> to displace GDP for **GTP**, *activating* it

3. Once active, the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">G protein</mark> dissociates from <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">GPCR</mark> and diffuses along the membrane, eventually binding to an enzyme, activating it, which can trigger the cellular response

4. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">G protein</mark> acts as a GTPase and hydrolyzes the bound GTP back to GDP and $P_i$ after a short period of time
