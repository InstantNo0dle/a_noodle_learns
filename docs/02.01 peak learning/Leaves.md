# Leaves

Leaves can be classified as **microphylls** or **megaphylls** based on size and complexity (scroll down for a bonus! ðŸ¤©)

**Microphylls** are small, spine-shaped leaves supported by only one vein of vasculature.
- Found in all [[Lycophyta|lycophytes]]

**Megaphylls** are larger and have highly branched vasculature, promoting greater productivity.
- Found in the rest of the vascular plants (both [[Seedless vascular plants|seedless]] and [[Seed vascular plants|seed]])

Aha! You have stumbled upon a *hidden* category -- reproductive leaves! (Why so excited, idk.) These are called [[Sporophyll|sporophylls]].
