# Orbital angular momentum quantum number

This is the second quantum number ($l$) that can be used to describe [[Atomic orbitals]]. 

For each [[Principal quantum number]], there are $n$ values of $l= 0, 1, ..., n-1$.
- Each group of orbital with the same $l$ is part of the same **subshell** ^a8144d

There are names for orbitals with different values of $l$, named after their spectroscopic lines:
- [[s-orbital]] ($l=0$) for sharp
- p-orbital ($l=1$) for principal
- d-orbital ($l=2$) for diffuse
- f-orbital ($l=3$) for fundamental


> [!note] $l$ also describes the **orbital angular momentum** of an electron: the rate at which the electron "circulates" around the nucleus.

- As $l$ increases, the orbital angular momentum also increases (can be seen in eq.)
$$
orbital\ angular\ momentum=[l(l+1)]^{1/2} \hbar
$$
