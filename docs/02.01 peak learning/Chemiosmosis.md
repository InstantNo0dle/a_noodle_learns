## Cellular Respiration
In cellular respiration, it acts as a driving force to power ATP generation by regulating the flow of protons through [[ATP synthase]]. 

A proton gradient is generated by proteins along the [[Electron Transport Chain]]:
- As electrons are transferred through redox reactions, protons are taken up and released into the surrounding solution
- Members of the ETC are specifically spatially arranged so that they take up protons from the **mitochondrial matrix** and deposit them into the **intermembrane space**.

> The proton gradient that is generated is known as the **proton-motive** force.
- This force drives protons back down their gradient allowing for synthesis of ATP to be coupled with their *exergonic* passing through

## Photosynthesis
Chemiosmosis in chloroplasts during photosynthesis is very similar to cellular respiration in mitochondria.

Differences:
- Mitochondria transfer chemical energy *from food* to ATP
- Chloroplasts transfer *light energy* to ATP (chemical energy)
- Spatial locations
	- The [[Electron Transport Chain#First Electron Transport Chain|first ETC]] pumps protons from the **stroma** (analagous to the matrix) to the **thylakoid space** (intermembrane s pace).
	- ATP synthase's catalytic knob is in the stroma -> ATP is produced in the stroma, all ready for the [[Calvin Cycle]]
