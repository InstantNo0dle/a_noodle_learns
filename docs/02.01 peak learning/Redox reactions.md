# Redox reactions

The most important part is balancing the reaction:
1. Figure out half-reactions
	- Write out oxidation states
	- Separate into oxidized reaction and reduced reaction
2. Balance half-reactions
	1. Balance all elements except $H$ and $O$
		- Balance $H$ by adding $\ce{H+}$
		- Balance $O$ by adding $\ce{H2O}$
	2. Add electrons to balance charge
3. Multiply each half reaction to form a closed circuit -- # of electrons should cancel out
4. If the reaction is under basic conditions, add $\ce{OH-}$ on both sides

There is **comproportionation** and **disproportionation**.
