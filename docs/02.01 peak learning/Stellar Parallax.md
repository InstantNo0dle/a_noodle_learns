This was <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Tycho Brahe</mark>'s argument against the Copernican model.

>[!note] Argument
>If the Earth really orbited the sun, then the position of a *nearby* star when observed from two locations in Earth's orbit, six months apart, should shift **further** than more distant *stars*.
- However, he noted that there was no shift and was thus convinced of the [[Geocentric View]] of the universe

The fault was that the distance to the nearest stars is **enormous** compared to the width of Earth's orbit, and any difference would only be noticeable through a tool as precise as a **telescope**.
