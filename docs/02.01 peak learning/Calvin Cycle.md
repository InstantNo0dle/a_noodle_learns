# Calvin Cycle
This takes place in the **chloroplast stroma** and uses NADPH and ATP to complete a cycle, taking in $CO_2$ to produce a three carbon sugar **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate**.

**Steps**:
The cycle needs to turn three times (use 3 $CO_2$ ) in order to produce one G3P.
1. **Carbon fixation**: Incorporating $CO_2$ into organic molceules present in the chloroplast ^28e4ec
	1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">RuBisCo</mark> (RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase) catalyzes the addition of $CO_2$ to the 5-carbon-sugar ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP)
		- RuBisCo is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth
	2. The six-carbon intermediate formed is so unstable that it immediately splits into *two* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">3-phosphoglycerate</mark> (3-PG) yielding *six* in total (because 3 $CO_2$)
2. **Reduction** of fixed carbon using NADPH as a reducing power
	1. Addition of phosphate group to 3-PG from <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ATP</mark> -> *six* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">1,3-bisphosphoglycerate</mark> (1,3-BPG)
	2. Reduction of 1,3-BPG by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NADPH</mark>  -> *six* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</mark> 
		- Specifically reduction of the **carboxyl** group of 1,3-BPG to an **aldehyde** group
3. **Regeneration** of $CO_2$ acceptor (RuBP)
	- Only *one* G3P exits the cycle because *15* carbons are needed to regenerate RuBP
		1. 18 in total ($6 \times 3$ carbons in G3P), RuBP is 5-carbon sugar
		2. $3 RuBP = 3 \times 5 = 15$ carbons to regenerate
		3. $18-15=3$ carbons to be released, in the form of G3P
	- Regeneration uses *3* more <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ATP</mark> to rearrange the carbon skeletons of *5* G3P into *3* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">RuBP</mark> for the next cycle
