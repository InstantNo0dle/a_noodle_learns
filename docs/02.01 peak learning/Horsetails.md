# Horsetails

They are also called *Arthrophytes* because of their jointed stem.

They used to be very abundant during Carboniferous period but now there is only one genus (*Esquisetum*)

There are some species separating reproductive (fertile) stems from vegetative stems. The fertile stems have [[Sporophyll#^957928|strobilli]] and are [[Sporophyll#^4b0ab8|homosporous]].

The jointed stem is main photosynthetic organ
- **Air canals** help bring oxygen to roots (often grow in waterlogged soil)
