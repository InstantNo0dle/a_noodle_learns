# Gram stain

This is a technique developed by **Hans Christian Gram** (Danish physician) that characterizes bacteria based on composition of cell walls.

Performing a gram stain:
1. Stain samples with **crystal violet dye** and **iodine**
2. Stain with red **safranin** that binds to DNA in the cell

[[Gram positive bacteria]] stain darker than [[Gram negative bacteria]].
