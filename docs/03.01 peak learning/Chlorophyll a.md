# Chlorophyll a
This is the **primary pigment** for photosynthesis.
- It absorbs light best at around **430-450** nm in the violet-blue side of the spectrum and **675** nm in the red side.
- Looks **blue-green** because it has very low absorbance of 500 nm (blue-green) light

It differs structrually from [[Chlorophyll b]] in that it has a methyl group $CH_3$ attached to the upper rightmost carbon.
- This is also why it absorbs different optimal wavelengths of light
