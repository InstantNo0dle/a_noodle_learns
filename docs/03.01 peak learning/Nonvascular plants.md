# Nonvascular plants

This group of plants lack an extensive transport system. The plants are often called **bryophytes** (not [[Bryophyta]], the phylum of mosses. I know, so confusing! ðŸ¤¡)

It consists of three phyla:
- [[Hepatophyta]] - Liverworts
- [[Bryophyta]] - Mosses
- [[Anthocerophyta]] - Hornworts

## Life cycle
The dominant life stage in [[Alternation of generations]] is **gametophyte**, which is larger and last longer than the sporophyte.
- Some germinating spores develop [[Protonema]] -- found in [[Bryophyta]]
- They are often low to the ground (like a carpet) because of lack of vasculature and lack of strength to support. But, [[Bryophyta|mosses]], being the true alpha have "stems" that have conducting tissues in the center and thus are able to grow quite tall (if you consider like 2 feet tall).
- Anchored by **rhizoids**, which aren't great for nutrient absorption, but do the job of holding them in place
- Produce multiple [[Gametangia]]
	- Flagellated sperm needs water to reach the eggs
- Also can reproduce asexually -- **brood bodies** in [[Bryophyta]]

Bryophytes have the smallest sporophytes, which are highly dependent on the gametophyte for water, nutrients, and remain attached.
- **Foot** anchors the sporophyte to the archegonium and absorbs nutrients ^63c36d
- **Seta** conducts nutrients to the sporangium ^186371
- **Sporangium**/**capsule** produces spores via mitosis
	- There is usually formation of a **peristome**, which serves as a "lid" to make sure spores don't "fall out" at the wrong times. It's basically a ring of interlocking teeth that open when it's *dry* and closes when it's *moist*.
