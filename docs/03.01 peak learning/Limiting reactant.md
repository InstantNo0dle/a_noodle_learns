# Limiting reactant

>[!info]+ Definition
>This is the reactant that is present in **less** than the required amount in order for the reaction to occur. The amount of product produced **directly depends** on the amount of the limiting reactant.

It can be determined by using two methods, explained below.

## Using reactants only
1. Find the [[Reaction stoichiometry#^09fc1|mole ratio]] between the reactants 
2. Choose one reactant to calculate the amount of the second reactant needed to complete the reaction
3. If actual amount of second reactant is *greater* than needed, it is in **excess** and the first reactant is limiting, and vice versa.

>[!example]+ M.2A (a) Identify the limiting reactant in the reaction$\ce{6 Na(l) + Al2O3(s)-> 2 Al(l) + 3 Na2O(s)}$ when $\ce{5.52 g}$ of sodium is heated with $\ce{5.10 g}$ of $\ce{Al2O3}$. (b) What mass of aluminum can be produced? (c) What mass of excess reactant remains at the end of the reaction?

## Predicting products
1. Find [[Reaction stoichiometry#^09fc1|mole ratio]] between each reactant and one product
2. Predict the amount of product produced by each reactant (it's fine to keep in [[Moles]], no need to convert to grams)
3. Whichever reactant produced the *least* amount of product is the limiting one

This method is good for when you have *greater* than 2 reactants

>[!example]+ M.3 An important step in the refining of aluminum metal is the manufacture of cryolite, $\ce{Na3AlF6}$, from ammonium fluoride, sodium aluminate, and sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution: $\ce{6 NH4F(aq) + Na[Al(OH)4](aq) + 2 NaOH(aq) -> Na3AlF6(s) + 6 NH3(aq) + 6 H2O(l)}$. In a laboratory investigation of the process, $\ce{100.0 g}$ of $\ce{NH4F}$ was mixed with $\ce{82.6 g}$ of $\ce{Na[Al(OH)4]}$ and $\ce{80.0 g}$ of $\ce{NaOH}$. The mass of $\ce{Na3AlF6}$ produced was $\ce{75.0 g}$. What was the percentage yield of the reaction?
