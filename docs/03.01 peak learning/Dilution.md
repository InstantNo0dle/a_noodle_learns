Dilution reactions are used to achieve a solution of a desired concentration using **stock solution**.
- Stock solution is a *concentrated* form of commonly used solutions

>The key strategy is remembering that:
>$$ moles\ of\ solute\ before\ dilution\ = moles\ of\ solute\ after\ dilution $$

$$
M_1V_1=M_2V_2

Different types of [[Pipets]] are used during a dilution reaction.
