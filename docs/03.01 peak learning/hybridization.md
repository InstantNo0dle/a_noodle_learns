This accounts for [[electron promotion]] in the [[valence bond theory]].

It is produced because the wavefunctions of electron density intefere with each other (constructively or destructively).
- Creates **hybrid orbitals**
	- These are different **linear arrangements** of combinations of the atomic orbitals (insert + and - between)
	- Denoted $s^np^m$ where n is the number of s orbitals and m is the number of p orbitals
	- These only differ in orientation, so they help explain **electron arrangement**

These hybrid orbitals have amplitudes concentrated on one side of the nucleus (due to interference), which overlaps better and creates stronger bonds.

**Hybrid orbitals** can be identified on an atom based on the **electron arrangement** as dictated by [[VSEPR model|vsepr]].
- Tetrahedral: $sp^3$
- Trigonal planar: $sp^2$
- Linear: $sp$
- Trigonal bipyramidal: $sp^3d$
	- Because it uses $d$ orbitals on central atom as well (for elements in period 3+)
- Octahedral: $sp^3d^2$

For terminal atoms, since there are no bond angles to predict from, use **lone pairs**.
