# s-orbital

This orbital is particularly special because it is spherically symmetric and has an [[Orbital angular momentum quantum number#^ecdfd8|orbital angular momentum]] of 0 (just there).

Since it is found much closer to the nucleus (of any [[Principal quantum number|n]]), it "penetrates" through the inner shells.
- Also because no orbital angular momentum
- This leads to having much lower energy, even lower than d-orbitals of lower shells once you get to $n=4$
