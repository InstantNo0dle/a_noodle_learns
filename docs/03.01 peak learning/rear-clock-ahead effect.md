>[!tldr] If two clocks are *synchronized* in the train frame, the ground observer sees the rear clock **ahead** of the front clock by an amount $\frac{L'v}{c^2}$.

- $L'$ refers to the length of the train as measured by the observer in the *rest* frame (on the moving train)
- Thus this relationship can be applied whenever $\Delta t'=0$ (clocks are synchronized)

Clocks are hit by photons and stop when they are hit. 
- According to the ground observer, the clocks are hit by photons simultaneously
- According to the **observer** in the train frame, the rear clock is hit *after* the front clock because the train is moving forward.

So, according to the ground observer, the clocks were not synchronized.
