They take on various forms; some are unicellular, others are much larger and more complex. 

There are multiple mechanisms that allowed for larger and more complex algae:
1. Colonies of individual cells
	- Pond scum (*Pediastrum*)
2. Cell division and differentiation leading to formation of "true" multicellular bodies
	- *Vulvox*
	- *Ulva* (sea lettuce)
3. Repeated nucleic division but no cytoplasmic division
	- Basically just one fat cell
	- *Caulerpa*

Structurally, they have bi-flagellated gametes and cup-shaped chloroplasts. Sexual reproduction occurs and some show [[Alternation of generations]].

Life cycle (unicellular *Chlamydomonas*):
1. Mature haploid cells, under stress, develop into gametes of different mating types
2. Different mating type gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote
3. Zygote makes a hard coat to protect against the elements
4. Meiosis produces two haploid cells of each mating type
	- Asexual reproduction can occur instead of developing into gametes
		1. Two flagella are reabsorbed
		2. Cells undergo two rounds to form four cells
		3. Each cell (zoospore) becomes a haploid cell
