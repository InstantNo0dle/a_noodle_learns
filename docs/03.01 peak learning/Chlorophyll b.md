# Chlorophyll b
This is an accesory pigment.
- It absorbs light best at around **450-475** nm on the violet-blue side and **630** nm on the red side.
- Looks **olive** green because of low absorbance around 525 nm (green-yellow) light

It differs structurally from [[Chlorophyll a]] in that it has $CHO$ instead of a methyl group attached to the uppermost right carbon.
