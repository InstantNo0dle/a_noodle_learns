- This can be applied when there events occur at the same position *according to the observer* on the train: $\Delta x' = 0$

You have a train with a light source at the floor of the train sending light upwards to the mirror on the ceiling that reflects the light back down.

Two events:
- Event A: Light is emtitted at the floor
- Event B: Light reaches the emitter after being reflected from the mirror
- Want to observe a the time difference according to two different observers (in the train, on the ground)

When viewing from an observer on the train, $\Delta t'_{AB} = \frac{2h}{c}$

When viewing from an observer on the ground, because the train is moving, there are two velocites to keep in mind (train and light).

- $\Delta t_{AB}=\frac{2h}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}$

Major assumption: [[perpendicular length contraction is conserved|perpendicular motion is the same for all observers]].

The ratio between these is called $\gamma$, sometimes called the *Lorentz factor*:
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
- $\gamma \geq 1$ , it's 1 when there is 0 velocity
