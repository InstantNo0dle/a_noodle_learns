# Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
This is an **inherited** disease that presents in patients as:
- Abnormal bleeding
- Eczema
- Predisposition to infections
- Leukemia

The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">WAS protein</mark> isn't present in patients with this syndrome:
- Located just beneath the surface of an immune cell to interact with microfilaments of the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways
	- Including <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">immune cell proliferation</mark> regulation pathway
- It is a [[Scaffolding Proteins|scaffolding protein]] that is an intersection point in multiple pathways controlling immune cell behavior
	- Thus when it is absent, leads to the symptoms
