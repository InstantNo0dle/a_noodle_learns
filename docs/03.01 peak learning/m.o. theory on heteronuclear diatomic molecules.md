# [[molecular orbital theory|m.o. theory]] on heteronuclear diatomic molecules
[[molecular orbitals#^ba99c7|Linear combination of atomic orbitals]] becomes $\psi = c_A\psi_A + c_B\psi_B$ where the coefficients are unequal because the atoms are different, thus polarity.
- Interpreting probabilities requires squaring:
	- $c_A^2>c_B^2$ means the molecular orbital will look more like atomic orbital of $A$.
		- Atom with orbitals of *lower energy* (more electronegative) will have higher value and "dominate" **bonding** orbital (electron density greater)
		- Opposite happens for **antibonding** orbitals

In general, use the same approach as you would for [[molecular orbital theory#^b6a400|diatomic molecules]], but alter the energy-level diagrams.
- Also much harder to predict so... maybe don't bother
	- $\sigma$ orbitals can be formed by all orbitals that have the right symmetry ($s$ and $p_z$)
		- So just denote as $1\sigma$, etc. without $p$ or $s$
- There is a calculated pattern for diatomic oxide molecules of the form $EO$:
