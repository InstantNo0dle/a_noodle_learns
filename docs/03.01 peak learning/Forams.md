# Forams

The formal name is **foraminiferans**, which translates to (in Latin) "bearing little hole". And little holes they do have, in their **tests** (shells), which are porous and hardened with $CaCO_3$ (calcium carbonate).

Pseudopodia extend out of the pores and help with movement, formation of the tests, and feeding. There are photosynthetic algae living in the test that also supply the foram with nutrients.

Most known species of forams are fossilized. Their calcium carbonate shells help form marine sediments.
- Often used to correlate sedimentary rocks from different places and study climate change
	- They take up less magnesium in colder water
