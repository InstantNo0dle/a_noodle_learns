# Alcohol Fermentation
In alcohol fermentation, [[NADH]] is regenerated to NAD+ through redox reactions with a derivative of pyruvate, **acetaldehyde**.

Steps:
1. Glycolysis
2. Pyruvate converted to acetaldehyde, releasing $CO_2$
3. Redox reaction oxidizing NADH and reducing acetaldehyde to **ethanol**.
