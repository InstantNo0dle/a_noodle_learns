# Regulation of Response
The regulation of the response to [[Cell Signaling]] is has **four** parts.
1. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Amplification</mark>: Signaling pathway amplifies the cell's response to the signaling molecule
	- Exponentially, because each enzyme can catalyze the formation of many product molecules, and this happens at every level of the pathway
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Coordination</mark>: Multi-step signaling pathway allows for finer regulation at key steps, specificity, and coordination with other pathways
	- Different cells have different proteins, which interact to form different signaling pathways, providing diverse effects across the body in response to the same signaling molecule
3. [[Scaffolding Proteins]] enhance the efficiency of the response
4. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Termination</mark> of the signal
	- To begin with, the cellular response only occurs once the amount of receptors saturated with signaling molecules is above a **threshold**
	- Once the external concentration of signaling molecules decreases, unbound receptors *revert* back to their inactive state, and the cell is "reset"
