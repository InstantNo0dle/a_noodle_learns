# Moles

>[!info]+ Definition
>This is a unit that is used to refer to the amount of a substance that is usually found in large quantities.
>- 1 mole of something has the same number of "stuff" as there are atoms in $\ce{12 g}$ of carbon-12, which is **Avogadro's constant** ($N_A=6.022 \times 10^{23}$)

Related measurements include the **amount of substance**, $n$, which is just the amount of moles. This can be used to calculate the **number of objects** (objects meaning atoms, molecules, etc.), $N$.
$$N = nN_A$$
- Or, just view as a dimensional analysis conversion block: $\frac{1\ mol}{6.022 \times 10^{23}\ objects}$, $\frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}\ objects}{1\ mol}$
