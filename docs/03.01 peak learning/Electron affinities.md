# Electron affinities

This property is essentially the opposite of [[Ionization energy]].

>It is the amount of energy released/required to **add** an electron to an element in the gas phase.

**Group 17 (halogens)** have very high electron affinities because of the high [[Effective nuclear charge]] experienced by existing electrons, so an incoming electron occupies a place pretty close to the nucleus.
- However it is pretty much impossible to add a second electron (second electron affinity is very negative and energy must be *supplied*) because doing so would mean occupying a new shell (greater [[Principal quantum number]])

**Group 16** atoms like $\ce{O}$ and $\ce{S}$ have two "spots" for electrons to be added, but only the first electron affinity is positive.
- The addition of a second electron requires overcoming repulsion from the already added electron (in the same orbital) which increases the energy of addition
