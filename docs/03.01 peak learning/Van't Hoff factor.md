# Van't Hoff factor (i)

>[!info]+ Definition
>It measures the *effect* of a solute on **colligative properties**, i.e. osmotic pressure, vapor pressure, boiling-point elevation, etc. Basically, it's how many **particles** are formed when the compound dissolves.

To calculate it, it's the ratio between the *actual* concentration of particles when the substance is dissolved and the *predicted* concentration from mass.
- For non-electrolytes, it's equal to 1
- For ionic compounds, it's equal to the number of **ions** in a **formula unit**
	- This doesn't take into account ion pairing, which occurs in all electrolyte solutions. So measured Van't Hoff factor is usually less than predicted.

It is related to the **degree of dissociation** of solute $\alpha$.
$$i = 1 + \alpha(n-1)$$
- $n$ is the number of ions the fraction of the solute $\alpha$ dissociates into

It is also related to **association** of a fraction $\alpha$ of $n$ [[Moles]] of solute to form a $n$-mer.
$$i = 1- \alpha(1-\frac{1}{n})$$
