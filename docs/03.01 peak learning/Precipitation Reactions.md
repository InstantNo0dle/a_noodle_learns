# Precipitation Reactions
A precipitation reaction occurs when two solutions are mixed to form an <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">insoluble substance</mark>.
- It is also known as a *double displacement reaction*

**Predicting** solid precipitate:
The key idea is to think about every possible product and consider its likelihood.
1. Write the mixtures as they would appear if dissolved in water
  	> [!important] 
  	> In virtually every case, when a solid containing ions dissolves in water, the ions **separate** and move independently.
2. Write out all the possibilities based on two rules:
	1. The resulting compound must have a zero net charge if formed with ions
	2. The compound contains only *two* types of ions -- one cation and one anion
3. If you know *properties* of the precipitate (most often color) use these to eliminate possibilities
- Knowledge of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">solubility rules</mark> is very important for prediction
	- **Slightly soluble** means that the amount of solid formed is so miniscule in amount that it cannot be seen with the naked eye

title: Simple Rules for Solubility of Salts in Water
collapse: open

1. Most **nitrate** ($NO_3^-$) salts are soluble
2. Most **alkali metal** ($Li^+, Na^+, K^+, Cs^+, Rb^+$) and **ammonium ion** ($NH_4^+$) salts are soluble
3. Most **chloride**, **bromide**, and **iodide** salts are souble
	- Except those with *silver*, *lead*, and *mercury*
4. Most **sulfate** ($SO_4$) salts are soluble
	- Except (notably) *barium*, *lead*, *mercury*, and *calcium*
5. Most **hydroxides** are only *slightly* soluble
	- NaOH and KOH are *fully* soluble
	- $Ba(OH)_2,Sr(OH)_2,Ca(OH)_2$ are *marginally* souble
6. Most **sulfide** ($S^{2-}$), **carbonate** ($CO_3^{2-}$), **chromate** ($CrO_4^{2-}$), and **phosphate** ($PO_4^{3-}$) salts are only slightly soluble
	- But, cations in rule 2 are exceptions
