# Earth's Rotation
Earth's rotation leads to day and night, and there are two types of "days".

**Mean solar day**: The time interval between the noon of one day and the noon of the next day
- Noon is when the Sun has reached the **zenith** (highest point in the sky)
- This is the run-of-the-mill, standard *24-hour* day

**Sidereal day**: The time it takes for Earth to make a complete $360 \degree$ rotation with respect to a distant star
- This is how long it takes for a star to reappear at the same exact position in the sky as it was the previous day
- *23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds*, which is almost 4 whole minutes shorter than a mean solar day

There is such a noticeable difference between the length of a sidereal and mean solar day because the direction to the *sun* changes by around $1\degree$ per day, but changes by a much **smaller** amount with respect to distant stars. ^6820d4
