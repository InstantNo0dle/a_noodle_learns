# perpendicular length contraction conserved

There are two rods (A and B) with paint brushes on both ends. Move the two rods past each other -- motion is now *orthogonal*.

Assume there is [[length contraction]]:
- If A sees B smaller than B sees itself (contracted), then B would not be painted.

However, if A sees B smaller than B sees itself, by the [[principle of relativity]], B also sees A smaller than A sees itself and would be painted.
- This leads to a contradiction: in the end, everyone should agree on whether B is painted or not, but if there is length contraction, it is not agreed upon.
