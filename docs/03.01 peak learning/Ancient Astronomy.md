# Ancient Astronomy
This period was mostly dominated by Greeks, Chinese, Babylonians, and Egyptians.

Theories/discovories during this period:
- [[Geocentric View]] 
- The planets are called that because of the word *planetai* in Greek, meaning "wanderer" as they didn't seem to have "fixed" positions like the other celestial objects.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Aristotle</mark> pointed out that the Earth cast a curved shadow on the Moon and determined it to be spherical
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Eratosthenes</mark> measured the **circumference** of the Earth quite accurately by observing the angles the Sun at noon cast on two cities.
- [[Heliocentric View#Aristarchus|Aristarchus' Heliocentric View]]
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Hipparchus</mark> was one of the greatest early Greek astronomers and made a star catalogue
	- He determined the location of ~850 stars, dividing them into 6 categories based on brightness -- a practice still used today
- [[Ptolemy's Model]]
