# Seedless vascular plants

These plants had true vasculature that enabled **branching**, which allowed for an increased in complexity and **multiple sporangia**.

Main characteristics:
- Dominant **sporophyte** life cycle
	- Gametophytes are visible to the naked eye but smaller, unlike [[Seed vascular plants]]
- Xylem and phloem -- vasculature
- Prominent roots and [[Leaves]]
- Most are [[Sporophyll#^4b0ab8|homosporous]]

There are two extant clades (which are also phyla) of seedless vascular plants:
- [[Lycophyta]]
- [[Monilophyta]]
