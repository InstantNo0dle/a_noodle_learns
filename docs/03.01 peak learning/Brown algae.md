These are the largest and most complex algae with all species being multicellular.

Some of them even have structural elements that resemble organs in [[Plants]]!
- **Holdfast**: Like the root and serves an anchoring purpose
- **Stipe**: Like the stem
- **Blades**: Like the leaves

They are mostly marine can be found along temperate coastlines with cold water currents.

They display a life cycle of [[Alternation of generations]].
1. **Sporangia** on the blade of the algae develop
2. **Zoospores** are produced via meiosis
3. Half of the zoospores divide mitotically and become female gametophytes, the other half become male
4. The egg remains attached to the female gametophyte and secretes a chemical signal to attract the sperm
5. The fertilized zygotes are still attached to the gametophyte when they start growing into sporophytes
