# Refluxes

This is used because heat is often used to drive reactions and the reactants may escape (vapor).

To solve this, there is some condensing to cool vapor and make sure the solvent doesn't escape.

Do not confuse with [[Distillation]]! Although they (maybe) look similar, they aren't for the same use.
