This is one of the ways to map the stars and other celestial objects: Naming the patterns of stars in the sky.
- Other way, perhaps more "scientifically" backed is the [[Equatorial System]]

There are **88** constellations recognized today, which are used to divide the sky into units that can be referred to by astronomers when they are studying that particular region.
- The brightest stars are named using the Greek alphabet (starting from $\alpha$ for the brightest) follwed by the name of the constellation
	- They were also given proper names (like Sirius, Arcturus, Betelgeuse)
