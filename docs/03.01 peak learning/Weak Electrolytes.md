# Weak Electrolytes
These are substances that ionize **very little** in water, producing relatively few when dissolved.

The most common classes of weak electrolytes are:
- Weak [[Acids]]: These only dissociate/ionize very slightly to produce a few $H^+$ in solution
	- Ex. Acetic acid ($HC_2H_3O_2$)
- Weak [[Bases]]: Similar to weak acids, these dissociate very slightly to produce very few $OH^-$ in solution
	- Ex. Ammonia ($NH_3$)
