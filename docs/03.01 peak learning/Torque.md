>[!note] Definition
>Torque is the **ability** of a force to rotate a body.
- This depends on the *magnitude* of the force's **tangential component** and the *distance* from the rotation axis that the force is applied.
- It has the units: $N \cdot m$

$$
\tau = (r)(F\ sin\ \phi) = rF_t
$$

An alternate way is $\tau = (r\ sin \phi)(F) = r_\perp F$
- $r_\perp$ is the **moment arm** of $\vec F$: perpendicular distance between rotation axis and **line of action** of $\vec F$
	- Likewise, $r$ can be considered the **moment arm** of $F_t$

It can be applied to **any** particle that moves along a path relative to a fixed point, but it needs to be written as a vector that may have direction.
- **Direction** can be found using the right-hand rule
$$
\vec \tau = \vec r \ \times\ \vec F
$$
