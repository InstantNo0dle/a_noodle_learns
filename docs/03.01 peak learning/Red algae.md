# Red algae

These algae are red because of the pigment **phycoerythrin** that masks the green pigment of chlorophyll. How pigmented the algae are depends on the depth. Algae living in shallower regions have less phycoerythrin and are more greenish-red while deeper algae are closer to black.
- Phycoerythrin helps them absorb blue and green light that penetrate further into the water -- more pigment is more beneficial in deeper waters.

Some algae are rebels. They refuse to be pigmented and instead become parasites living on other red algae (so considerate).

Unlike all other algae, they don't have flagellated gametes and instead rely on good ol' mother nature (water currents) to bring gametes together.
