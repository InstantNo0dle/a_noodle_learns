# Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are membrane receptors that transfer phosphate groups to **tyrosine** residues.

Structure (*monomer*):
- Extracellular ligand binding site
- One transmembrane $\alpha$ helix
- Intracellular "tail"-like structure with tyrosine residues attached

**Steps** for reception:
1. RTKs exist as **monomeric** individual units, before they are activated by binding of a ligand
2. **Dimerization**: Binding of a ligand causes two RTKs to cluster together to form a dimer

3. **Autophosphorylation**: Dimerization activates the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">tyrosine kinase region</mark> of the RTKs, causing them to autophosphorylate
	- i.e. one <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">tyrosine kinase</mark> on one monomer phophorylates the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">tyrosine</mark> on the tail of the other monomer

1. Once the tyrosines are phosphorylated, they are **recognized** by enzymes in the cell, which, upon binding, change shape and are activated

Examples:
- Abnormal function of RTKs are associated with many cancers
	- Breast cancer patients have a worse prognosis if they have tumor cells that have excessive **HER2**, a type of RTK
		- **Herceptin**, a drug that binds to HER2 and inhibits cell division, improves survival rates by over $\frac{1}{3}$
