# Heliocentric View
This perspective that the Sun was the center of the universe was originally proposed by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Aristarchus</mark>, who calculated the relative distances from the Earth to the Sun and Moon.

## Aristarchus
He found that the distance between the Earth and Sun was much **further** than from the Moon and many times **larger** than Earth.
- This led him to believe that the **Sun** was the center

## Copernicus
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Copernicus</mark>, from discovering <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Aristarchus</mark>' writings, was convinced that the Earth was a planet and that everything could be better explained with a rotating Earth.
- He justified the reason for the Sun to be the center philosophically

He used [[Ptolemy's Model]]'s **epicycles** and **deferents**, since he still thought planets had *circular* orbits.

He was revolutionary in that he challenged the so widely accepted (almost like a fact) [[Geocentric View]], leading to others following in his footsteps.

## Kepler
[[Kepler's Laws]] were based off the fact that the planets revolved around the sun.

## Galileo
Using a **telescope**, he made many discoveries:
1. Jupiter's moons (four largest)
	- This disputed the notion that Earth was the only center of motion.
	- It also proved that no, the Moon would **not** be "left" behind if the Earth orbited the Sun
2. Planets are not points of light, but **circular** disks
	- More Earth-like than star-like
3. Venus has **phases**, like the moon, and appears smallest in its full phase
	- Ptolemy's geocentric model would propose that Venus would only be able to be seen in its crescent phases
4. The Moon isn't a glass sphere, but has craters, plains, and mountains
5. The Sun has **sunspots** (RIP Galileo's eyes)
	- These were used to determine that the Sun rotated (by tracking them over a month)
