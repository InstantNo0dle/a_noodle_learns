# My running journey

## It started in spring 2021...
...with spring track of 8th grade. I had just finished swim season and felt excited to see my friends again every day since it was still pandemic stage hybrid school. I was not the best at running for sure, but it was pretty fun albeit the shin splints (most likely due to my bad form and shoes). I even tried hurdling (although, again, shin splints)! It was at this time that I got my first pair of *real* running shoes: New Balance Fuel Cell Rebel v1.

### Summer of 2021: Faster but...
When the season wrapped up, I had this determination to get faster and stronger over the summer. I developed the discipline to wake up at ~6:50 AM 6x a week to go on a 4-7 mile run. It was during these runs that I completely fell in love with the sport. I'm still not sure how I did this as multiple times a week, I also went for an afternoon swim! Not everything about this was good, though: I was definitely not eating as much as I should have -- I lost a lot of weight, hair started falling out, and my period stopped for around 6 months. Nevertheless, I did get much faster.

### XC Season 2021: Breakthroughs and managing priorities
Even though cross country season coincided with swim season, I chose to run. My hard work over the summer paid off and by the end of the season I had qualified for All County and Conference with a time of 21:38 (I PR'ed in the 4th league meet at Eisenhower). I even won a medal at Sunken Meadow Invitational, being one of two from the school team to medal. During this time, I got my second pair of shoes: Hoka One One Rincon 2 (a real speedy boi). Although this was just my first season of XC, I was already struggling to make time for everything. Because cross country practices lasted 'till 4:50 PM most days and were pretty taxing, I didn't have enough time nor energy to spend on studies. So I had to miss practices. A few, at first, but then almost a whole week would go by where I didn't show up. Do I regret it now? Yes, definitely. I eventually missed meets as well, which forfeited my position in the team to run at County Champs. But I was still running pretty much every day and still got a lot faster. This momentum pushed me through to the winter season.

### Winter 2021: No winter track, increased mileage, increased intensity, and...
Sure, not getting to run at county champs was quite disappointing, but I still loved running -- not just the competitive side, but the very act and essence. I began ramping up the mileage and pushing myself to run faster; I had gotten my first gps watch (Apple Watch SE) and started posting on Strava.
