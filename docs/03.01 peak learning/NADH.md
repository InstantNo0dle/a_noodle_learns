# NADH
NADH is an **electron carrier** in aerobic respiration because of its ability to easily switch between reduced and oxidized states.
- It produces around **2.5** ATP per molecule

The mitochondrial outer membrane is *impermeable* to NADH, so it relies on shuttles.
- Depending on the shuttle and the cell type, NADH may be passed to $FADH_2$ or NADH in the mitochondrial matrix, which is why there is a rough estimate of 30-32 ATP produced
	- In **brain** cells, NADH will be shuttled to $FADH_2$ 
	- In the **liver** and **heart** cells, it will be shuttled to NADH, producing more ATP
