# Principal quantum number

The electron's **wavefunctions** are confined in the atom by the pull of the nucleus, to certain energies.

To quantize those energies:
1. Find the potential energy (Coulomb) of an electron with charge $-e$ distanced $r$ from the nucleus
$$
V(r) = \frac{(-e) \times (+e)}{4\pi \epsilon_0r}=-\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_\theta r}
$$
2. Solve the Schrodinger equation (much easier said than done ðŸ˜†) for a particle with the equation's potential energy
$$
E_n=-\frac{hR}{n^2}, \ R=\frac{m_ee^4}{8h^3\epsilon_\theta^2}, n=1,2,...
$$
- $R$ is **Rydberg constant**, also equal to $\ce{3.29 x 10^15 Hz}$
- Multiply by number of protons ($Z$) for other one electron ions

$n$ is also called the **principle quantum number**, ranging from 1 (@ lowest energy level) to $\infty$ (electron almost escapes from nucleus). 
- Lowest energy possible is $-hR$, called the **ground state** when $n=1$
- Highest energy level possible is 0, when $n=\infty$ and the electron is on the verge of escaping
> [!important] As $n$ increases, the energy levels are closer together.
