# Pressure
The pressure **in a fluid** is the normal force per unit area:
$$p = \frac{dF_\perp}{dA}$$
- $F_\perp$ is the force **normal** to the fluid

**S.I. Unit**: $N/m^2 = Pa$ aka *Pascal*

**Common Unit**: $1.01 \times 10^5 Pa = 1\ atm$ aka *atmosphere*
- Average atmospheric pressure at **sea level**

Pressure at a given depth $h$ in a fluid of *uniform density*:
$$p = p_0 + \rho gh$$
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
```ad-danger
Don't forget the $p_0$, especially if it's an open container!!
```

Measuring *atmospheric* pressure is done with a [[barometer]] while measuring *system* pressure is done with a [[manometer]].
