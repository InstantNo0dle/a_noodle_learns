# Plasmodium

This is the [[Apicomplexans|Apicomplexan]] protist that is responsible for causing malaria. 

It lives inside host cells and continually changes surface proteins (like [[Chagas' disease#^37dfe7|trypanosomes]]), which makes it hard to treat.

Life cycle:
1. An infected mosquito bites a human and transmits *Plasmodium* **sporozoites**
2. Sporozoites enter the liver cells and divide mitotically to become **merozoites**. The merozoites penetrate red blood cells using apical complexes.
3. Merozoites continue to undergo mitosis in the RBC until they break out and burst the cell
4. Some merozoites become **gametocytes**
5. A different mosquito bites the person and picks up gametocytes
6. Gametes form and fertilization happens in the mosquito's digestive tract
7. A zygote is formed
8. **Oocyst** develops on the wall of the digestive tract and ultimately releases many sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands
