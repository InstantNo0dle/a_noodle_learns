# Lactic Acid Fermentation
In lactic acid fermentation, [[NADH]] is regenerated to NAD+ through redox reactions with **pyruvate** directly.

In muscle cells, when sugar catabolism in cells is much faster than oxygen can be supplied from the blood, lactate fermentation occurs.
- Excess lactate is carred back to the **liver** where it's converted back to pyruvate. The pyruvate can then enter cells to be used to complete aerobic respiration once thee's enough oxygen.
- Used to be blamed for muscle pain, but that may actually be **accumulated potassium**
