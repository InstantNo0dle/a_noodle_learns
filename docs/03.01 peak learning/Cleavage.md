# Cleavage
This is the *tendency* of a mineral to break along planes of **weak bonding**, not to be confused with *crystal shape*.

When the mineral is broken, if it has cleavage, it will produce relatively **smooth** surfaces.

It can be described by the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">number of cleavage directions</mark> and the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">angle</mark> of cleavage.
- Think about the number of cleavage directions as the number of **planes**

| Sample     | Number of Cleavage Directions | Shape               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Muscovite  | 1                             | Flat sheets         |
| Feldspar   | 2 at $90\degree$              | Rectangular prism   |
| Hornblende | 2 not at $90\degree$           | Parallelogram prism |
| Halite     | 3 at $90 \degree$               | Cubes               |
| Calcite    | 3 not at $90 \degree$         | Rhombohedron        |
| Fluorite   | 4                             | Octahedron          |
