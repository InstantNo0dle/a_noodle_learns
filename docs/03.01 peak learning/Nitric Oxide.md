# Nitric Oxide
Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that causes **relaxation** of muscles.
- Includes those in the wall of arteries

When it is released by a cell, it diffuses into a neighboring cell and causes production of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">cGMP</mark> (similar to [[cAMP]]).
- cGMP then acts as a [[Second Messengers|second messenger]] causing the effects such as relaxation

Compounds that **prolong** the signal cGMP initiates have been prescribed to treat <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">chest pain</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">erectile dysfunction</mark> in males.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Viagra</mark> is widely used to treat erectile dysfunction because it leads to dilation of blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the penis
