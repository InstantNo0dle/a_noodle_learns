# Fracture
This is the property describing how minerals break; is exhibited when bonds are almost **equally strong** in all directions.

**Types**:
- Most minerals have *irregular* fracture, producing uneven surfaces.
- Quartz has *conchoidal* fracture, which produces glass-like, smooth and curved surfaces
- Splintery fractures
- Fibrous fractures
