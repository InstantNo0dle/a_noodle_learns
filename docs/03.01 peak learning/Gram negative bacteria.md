# Gram negative bacteria

These bacteria are more complex than [[Gram positive bacteria]], having an additional outer membrane:
1. Thin inner wall of peptidoglycan
2. Thick outer membrane with lipopolysaccharide
	- The lipid part of lipopolysaccharide is toxic, causing fever and shock.

They are generally more resilient than gram positive bacteria to bodily defenses and antibiotics because of its thick outer membrane.
