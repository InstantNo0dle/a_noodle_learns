# Acid-base reactions

This describes for Arrhenius/Bronsted Lowry definition acids. Go to [[Lewis acid-base reactions]] for those.

Generally, the reaction goes $$\ce{acid + base -> salt + water}$$
But depends on strength:
- Strong acid + strong base
	- All reactants dissociate
- Strong acid + weak base and vice versa
- Weak acid + weak base
	- None of reactants dissociate
	- Reaction happens very slowly and ends with formation of water
