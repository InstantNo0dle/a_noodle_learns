This setup was used to detect the magnetic properties of chemicals.
- Now, a more common/modern approach is to use a **superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)**

A long, thin sample is hung from a **balance** to rest between the poles of an **electromagnet**.

Magnetism is determined by how the sample *moves* when the electromagnet is turned on.
- **Diamagnetic** substances move *upward*
	- Seems to weigh *less* than when the magnet is off
	- The field circulates electrons around in the substance, creating its own magnetic field *opposing* the one of the electromagnet, so it moves up and away(!)
- **Paramagnetic** substances move *down*
	- Appear to weigh *more*
	- Spins of unpaired electrons act like bar magnets that try to line up with the field
		- The more spins that are aligned, the "heavier" the substance seems
		- After the field is removed, the spins return to a *random* orientation
