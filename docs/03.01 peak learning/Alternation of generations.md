# Alternation of generations

This is a type of life cycle commonly seen in [[Plants]] and some algae where there is an alternation between multicellular diploid and haploid forms of the organism.

Usually, the multicellular diploid is called the **sporophyte** and the multicellular haploid is called the **gametophyte**.

Starting from the sporophyte, the life cycle looks a little something like this:
1. Sporophyte undergoes meiosis to produce spores
2. Spores undergo mitosis and becomes the gametophyte
3. Gametophyte undergoes mitosis to produce gametes
4. Gametes fertilize and become the sporophyte
