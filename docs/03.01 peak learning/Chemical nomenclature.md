# Chemical nomenclature

Rare ions
- Oxalate: $\ce{C2O4^{-2}}$
- Phthalate: $\ce{C8H4O4^{2-}}$
- Thiocyanate
	- Thio means replace an oxygen with sulfur
- Superoxide
	- Peroxide
- Arsenate
	- Analagous to phosphate
- Arsenite
	- Analagous to phosphite
- Selenate
	- Analgous to sulfate
- Selenite
	- Analagous to sulfite

Halogen oxyanions
- Perbromate
	- Per = "more oxygen"
- Bromate
- Bromite
- Hypobromite
	- Hypo = "less oxygen"

ate = slightly more oxygen
ite = less

-ide as suffix = monoatomic anion
- Exception is cyanide ($CN^-$) because cyanide is a "pseudohalide"

ic = more oxidized
ous = less oxidized

Ion charges
- Main group elements usually have a n and n+2 oxidation state
	- Dominating state depends on row
		- Lighter ones: n+2
		- Heavier: n
- Lanthanides mostly have $\ce{Ln^{3+}}$ oxidation
	- Cerium (adopts $4+$) and europium (also adopts $2+$) are exceptions
- Mercurous cations always come in pairs
