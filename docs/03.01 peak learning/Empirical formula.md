# Empirical formula

> [!info]+ Definition
> An empirical formula is the smallest reducible "building block" of a compound. 

Another way to phrase it is the *relative* relationship between elements of a compound.

You can determine the empirical formula based on **mass percentage composition**, i.e., you're given the percent mass an element of the compound is.
1. Assume the total mass of the compound is $\ce{100 g}$ and calculate "masses" of the elements based on mass % comp.
2. Calculate # of [[Moles]] for each element
3. Divide by smallest #
4. Multiply by some factor to make ratios as close to whole #

>[!example]+ F.3B The mass percentage composition of the compound thionyl difluoride is $\ce{18.59\% O}$, $\ce{37.25\% S}$, and $\ce{44.16\% F}$. Calculate its empirical formula.

Another method that works well for organic compounds with only $\ce{C, H, O}$ is [[Combustion analysis]].
