# Fermentation
Fermentation is essentially glycolysis plus reactions to **regenerate** NADH (because there is no [[Electron Transport Chain]] that normally does that job).
- Commonly through redox reactions with **pyruvate** or derivatives

Two types of fermentation:
- [[Alcohol Fermentation]]
- [[Lactic Acid Fermentation]]
