# Equal-field system

This was introduced by the [[Tang dynasty]] to try to reduce poverty. The [[Song dynasty]] continued this practice.

The system regularly *redistributes land*. Large plots of land are bought from more wealthy families (aristocracy) and sold at affordable prices/loaned to peasants.
- Sent surveyors out to see how much land there is and how much poverty there is

It provided opportunities for the lower classes to “work themselves out of poverty”. It also prevented concentration of a large aristocracy and persistent poverty in the lower classes that caused collapse of Han dynasty.
