# Sui dynasty

It rose in the early 580s and looked like "just another factional struggle" that often occurred after the fall of the Han, but obviously turned out to be much more than that.
- First, Zhou empire governing northern China was conquered, then Chen kingdom in the south.

[[Wendi]] was the first emperor who established the dynasty and reunited China after much time of decentralization. His son, [[Yangdi]] killed him and rose to power. 
- Yangdi was also killed ðŸ¤¯ soâ€¦

It seemed like the assassination meant the return of China to a warring era, but the emergence of the [[Tang dynasty]] stopped this from happening.
