# Yang Jian aka Wendi
**Yang Jian** was the first emperor of the [[Sui dynasty]].

Rise to power:
- He came from a noble northern Chinese family
- He formed an alliance with the ruler of the northern Zhou emperor by marrying his daughter off to him
- Then he yeeted the Zhou emperor (his son-in-law) off the throne and declared himself emperor

He secured power by winning over nomadic military commanders.
- Confirmed their titles
- Didn't favor scholar-gentry class over them
- After ruling over much of the north, he renamed himself **Wendi** (Literary Emperor)

He then took over the fragmented Chen kingdom in the south to reunite much of China for the first time in a long time.

He gained popularity by lowering taxes and establishing storage for grain over China to make sure there would be enough food in case of flooding or drought.

Wendi died at his son, [[Yangdi]]'s hand.
